Pitchbook and the Angel Resource Institute have just released the 2016 edition of their Annual ARI HALO Report , a research paper designed to explain the most recent trends and activity from top - ranked angel groups across the nation . The report is n't just a look at 2016 : It 's a snapshot of the mentalities that the best angel groups share as they head into 2017 . Here is a selection of quick takeaways from the PDF , which can be found here . The median angel group investment in 2016 was $ 127,000 , while the median round size was $ 950,000 . In other words , more than one angel group is needed to fund a round . Angel groups are syndicating in order to spread out the risk of a round into a number of smaller investments . Pre - money valuations are on the downswing . The biggest Angel groups are making smaller first - round investments to shift their capital towards ( safer ) follow - on rounds . From the report : " 2016 was the first year where angel groups did more follow - on deals than first - time investments in new portfolio companies . " The Central Texas Angel Network and the Houston Angel Network both take first place for the top angel groups with the most deals . The Hyde Park Angel Network comes in third . The well - established trend of the startup community name - checking a commitment to look beyond it 's male bubble while failing to do so is continuing : Just 17 percent of all deals in 2016 were led or founded by a female entrepreneur , while men landed 83 percent of the deals . Numbers get worse when those women are minorities : 3 percent of all deals were led or founded by female minorities , compared to 25 percent of all deals being led or founded by male minorities .
