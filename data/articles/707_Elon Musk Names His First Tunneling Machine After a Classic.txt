In the case of the Tesla car models , it has gotten him into some trouble . Tesla makes three different vehicles , the Model S , the Model 3 and the Model X -- which put together spell out S3X or SEX . Some Tesla owners did n't quite get the joke , and thought that the Model 3 was an upgrade on the Model S , according to The Wall Street Journal . However , for his more recent venture , underground tunneling initiative The Boring Company , Musk opted to go for a slightly higher brow choice for the name of its first tunneling machine . Naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems & plays . Decided against plays & poems . Too obvious . First machine is Godot . Still waiting ... Do n't know why , when or where . The name is taken from Waiting for Godot , the classic play by Samuel Beckett in which two characters named Vladimir and Estragon wait for someone named Godot who -- 64-year - old spoiler alert -- never actually shows up .   What that actually means for the fate of the new company is really anyone 's guess . But Musk said that the next machine 's name will likely be inspired by Robert Frost . @Tragik187 Third one will be from Frost . Maybe the second . Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com .
