Eurostar , the high - speed railway service from London to Paris and beyond , is challenging UK technology start - ups to pitch ideas that will improve its customer experience . Run in partnership with VivaTech , the challenge is looking for ideas that use tech to personalise & inspire frequent travel , use facial recognition to create an automated and personalised experience at the station , and explore how machine learning and artificial intelligence can do the same for the website , app and lounge experience . Ideas will be judged on four key criteria : their time to market , the experience and expertise of their team , their competitive advantage and their business model . Finalists will be invited to pitch their ideas at the Paris conference , travelling together and taking part in an on - board mentoring session . The overall winner will receive a paid pilot with Eurostar , while second and third place will get a year 's supply of Standard Premium tickets for two between London and Paris .
