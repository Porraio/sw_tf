Scott Eisen / AP Images for Gillette Gillette is facing stiff competition . Now , in an effort to win back customers , it 's taking a page straight out of its competitors ' playbooks . After slashing prices across the board and launching a marketing campaign called " Welcome Back , " Gillette has now introduced a new way to buy blades directly from the company . Called Gillette On Demand , the service mimics the direct - to - consumer models of competitors like Harry 's and Dollar Shave Club . It allows customers to either buy blades as needed or build a custom subscription . Three of Gillette 's products are offered as part of the service , acting as three separate tiers : disposable Sensor 3 razors ( $ 11 for eight razors ) , the tri - bladed Mach3 turbo ( $ 13 for five refills ) , and the top - of - the - line Gillette Fusion Proshield ( $ 21.45 for four refills ) . Subscribers are rewarded for their loyalty with their fourth order free , while others can text or email the company at any time to order for a one - time purchase . Gillette is increasingly feeling the threat from startups like Harry 's and the now Unilever - owned Dollar Shave Club , which are eating away at its dominance in the global men's - razor business . Gillette claimed a US market share of 70% as recently as 2010 , but it fell to 54% in 2016 , according to the Wall Street Journal , which cited data - tracking firm Euromonitor . Harry 's and Dollar Shave Club now combine for a 12.2% market share , up from 7.2% in 2015 , according to Euromonitor .
