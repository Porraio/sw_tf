Whether out for a night with friends or quietly celebrating at home , it can be hard to self - monitor alcohol intake . But thanks to Milo Sensors , you do n't have to . The startup is creating " the next generation of wearable biosensors that gain blood - level insights in a non - invasive way , " its website says . The way is Proof , a wrist - worn biometric sensor that tracks your blood alcohol level without needing to blow into a breathalyzer or take a blood test . Sync the dime - sized sensor to a smartphone for real - time , customizable notifications .   Proof -- named for the measure of the content of ethanol in an alcoholic beverage -- looks like a generic fitness tracker , but instead of counting calories , it calculates alcohol content for 12-plus hours . Milo Sensors ' device relies on a disposable cartridge , attached magnetically to the underside of the band ; the patent - pending accessory converts perspired alcohol into an identifiable level . The wristband then lights up and vibrates once you reach a pre - selected blood - alcohol - content limit -- a warning to stop drinking , or face the consequences in the morning . A rechargeable battery lasts up to four days of continuous use ( a sure sign you have a problem ) . Interested drinkers can sign up online for product updates and pre - order details . A release date and retail price have not yet been revealed .

The technology looks like a small circuit board , but analyzes sweat and communicates wirelessly with a handset or smartwatch to determine your level of intoxication .
