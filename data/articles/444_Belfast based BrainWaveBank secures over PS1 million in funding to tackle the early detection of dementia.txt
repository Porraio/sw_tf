BrainWaveBank , a health - tech startup that develops data - centric solutions for tracking brain health , has just secured over PS1 million in funding from the Government - backed Angel CoFund , techstart NI , Innovate UK and Invest Northern Ireland totalling . BrainWaveBank was founded in 2015 and is helping to address major cognitive health problems through innovative technology . Dementia has a dramatic effect on the lives of sufferers and carers , affecting many millions of people around the globe , and there is critical need for early detection technologies . BrainWaveBank 's technology allows individuals to easily track their cognitive health on a daily basis from their home . A low - cost wearable device , together with a smartphone or tablet , will combine the user 's responses while playing games that challenge different cognitive skills with recordings of their brain activity . Through advanced analytics and machine learning methods , the system will detect the earliest signs of cognitive decline and empower people to make simple lifestyle changes to encourage healthy aging of the brain . Finding the first precursors of dementia will also give medical and pharmaceutical researchers the power to develop new therapies , and in the future prevent or cure the disease . BrainWaveBank is also active in contact sports . Both professional and amateur sports teams are increasingly concerned with players ' cognitive health and the effect of impacts on their long - term brain health . American football has accepted that sports - related concussion can lead to debilitating brain disorders later in life , and there is growing consciousness of the issue in rugby , soccer , and ice hockey . BrainWaveBank 's platform can profile each player 's brain fitness and track the day - to - day performance of the player over the course of the season , providing insight into subtle effects of impacts , sleep and other training and lifestyle factors on the short- and long - term cognitive health of the players . This round of funding will see the business invest heavily in technology as it looks to build out its neuroscience platform and further develop affordable hardware for mass consumer markets . This will be a major step forward in the business ' mission to dramatically reduce the cost of measuring cognitive performance via brainwave activity and to take sophisticated brain imaging out of the lab and into the home . Ronan Cunningham , the CEO and co - founder of BrainWaveBank stated : " We founded BrainWaveBank with the goal of transforming the early detection and treatment of devastating cognitive illnesses such as dementia . We are very excited to be supported in achieving this vision by such a strong team of leading technology investors and innovation agencies . This funding allows us to significantly accelerate our technology development and bring our product to market where it can help people live longer , healthier , and more connected lives . " Tim Mills , Investment Director at the Angel CoFund commented : " Considerable progress has been made in recent years around the awareness and treatment of issues with cognitive health - but it 's clear that the human brain is still the least understood part of the human body . We 're backing BrainWaveBank because we believe they have a huge opportunity to advance the fight against dementia and better manage the treatment of impact related concussion , and we 're proud to be part of their journey .
