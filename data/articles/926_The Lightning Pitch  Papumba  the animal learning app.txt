startup pitches . Company : Papumba . Headquarters : Buenos Aires , Argentina . Founding Team : Four dashing Argentinians , CEO Gonzalo Rodriguez , CPO Andres Ballone , Co - Founder Pablo Capurro and Co - Founder Santiago Capurro . Why we like it : Everyone cares about education and everyone cares about children . Well there 's really no choice with kids , they will rule over us when we 're in a nursing home . So getting them on the right path is pretty important .   Papumba develops and publishes education games for mobile devices , designed to help young children to develop cognitively while playing with educational applications . We ca n't deny that in our modern century once a baby is born their fingers are already trained to type on a keyboard and dial a number . So uniting technology with education is a logical combination .    Currently Papumba has seven different apps , six million downloads and 85,000 kids playing everyday . It 's doing pretty well . It offers games ranging from animal lessons to the alphabet to basic vocabulary to numbers . Each game app uses various techniques of song , dance , colours , voice and other fun strategies to motivate the kid to keep learning in this critical stage of their life . Their most recent educational app , Animal World helps babies and toddlers learn about the exotic animal tribes around the world . Players can explore the sounds and characteristics of more than 80 animals from the jungle , to the ocean to farms and play trivia and match - it - mini games to really test their knowledge . Papumba 's educational games are created using guidance from childhood experts and the most important teachers themselves , the child 's parents . Improvements are made based on comments and feedback Papumba receives to meet the needs of both parent and child . For children , playing should be a full time job and with Papumba they might actually be working harder than you .
