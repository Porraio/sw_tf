More posts by this contributor :     The rise of " Generation Health " The six people you meet in Shenzhen      Cyril Ebersweiler is the founder and managing partner of Hax , the Shenzhen and SF - based hardware startup accelerator .   Benjamin Joffe is a partner with Hax , the Shenzhen and SF - based hardware startup accelerator .   More than two years ago we wrote about what we learned from the 20 campaigns our startups had run . Fast - forward to 2017 : The B2C startups HAX has invested in now count more than 75 successful campaigns ( our 200-strong portfolio is about half B2C ) . Ninety percent raised more than $ 100,000 and 10 raised more than $ 1 million , putting them in the world 's top 100 . Those include the top campaigns from Canada , Australia and France . All this was done by pre - seed startups on very short time frames -- so either they were very lucky , or we understood a thing or two ! Now here is what you need to know to succeed in 2017 . Crowdfunding is not limited anymore to cheap consumer gadgets ( if it ever was ) . In fact , simple gadgets that do well , like the Fidget Cube , which raised close to $ 6.5 million , could be copied even before they ship ( the quality of the copies -- though made before the original -- are in question , but still ) . HAX experience : As investors , we decided to focus on " hard things " and helping startups move fast . WAZER raised $ 1.3 million for its $ 5,000 desktop waterjet cutter , and Lief Therapeutics collected $ 400,000 for its smart patch to fight stress ( closer to a medical device than a mass - market gadget ! ) With a few rare exceptions , our startups haven't really suffered from copycats . Makeblock , a Shenzhen - based startup from the first HAX program that makes innovative STEM robots , did face some . Its founder , Jasen Wang , tells us : " Copycats only mimicked part of the hardware . They lack skills in software development and ca n't deliver a good user experience . " While Jasen adds that large companies generally wo n't dare do a straight copy to avoid damaging their reputation , they can definitely get " inspired " -- like LG might have been with the AI assistant Jibo . Once your idea is visible -- and a Kickstarter hit is -- if you do n't ship first , someone else will . Takeaway : If you want to build a startup , do something hard and move fast . If you worry about protecting your product from copycats , read this . If it 's successful and easy to copy , it will be Even well - funded hits like Kreyos ( Indiegogo , $ 1.5 million ) , Zano ( Kickstarter , PS2.3 million ) or , more recently , Lily Robotics , fail to deliver because of technology or manufacturing . Do n't crowdfund if critical elements of your tech are not ready . Or , if you do , make very clear what works and what does n't to give your backers a proper view of the risks . For manufacturing , understand your costs and research manufacturing processes and suppliers before you go live . HAX experience : There is a reason HAX startups spend a minimum of three months in Shenzhen with us before crowdfunding : Alibaba.com or a " shotgun wedding " over a rushed trip to Shenzhen will probably not solve your problems . The founders of WAZER , the first desktop waterjet cutter , raised $ 1.3 million on Kickstarter , but decided to postpone their campaign to finalize one more prototype iteration after the HAX program to ensure they were confident about their technology . They went on to do live demos at NY Maker Faire . Takeaway : De - risk your tech and cost your manufacturing before crowdfunding . WAZER collecting ribbons at Maker Faire NYC : The proof is in the cutting ! ( Source : WAZER ) The time of just putting a page online is pretty much over . Having a well - produced video and good illustrations are mandatory today . Illustrations might only cost tens to hundreds of dollars , but video work tends to range between $ 5,000 ( with freelancers and small shops ) to $ 10,000 or more ( with bigger productions ) . Most HAX videos were done on a $ 5,000-$10,000 budget . Keep the video focused on the product and avoid distracting story lines . HAX experience : Jamie Grant , creator of the " digital ski coach " Carv , the top - ranking sports wearable on Kickstarter , says : " I analyzed a lot of campaigns in the same category ( good and bad ) and noted their pros and cons . I got the key value proposition straight up , and then the rest of the video added features . I went for a two - part approach . The first is like a commercial , then we have a separate section with the founders . " Takeaway : Do n't splurge , but budget enough . Your video will be your main promotion tool . Media coverage helps achieve the typical " L " shape ( with serif ) and more rarely " U " shape . Because of overconfident or unscrupulous creators , journalists have been burned too many times . Most recently , Lily Robotics faked the video of its selfie drone and is now under criminal investigation . Today , journalists will often want to see a live demo of your technology before covering it . Should you DIY or hire a PR specialist ? Those services can cost thousands of dollars , are very hit or miss and results vary widely with the product , so evaluate your options carefully . Regardless , your demo should be flawless . Here is some sound advice on how to crush a hardware demo . Note that trade shows in your industry -- Toy Show , Home Show , Snow Show , etc . -- are often better than broader startup events and general media . You will stand out in front of the right media there . HAX experience : Our startups have tried everything from email blasts to journalists , targeted intros and trade shows . Find the right fit ; your mileage may vary . Takeaway : Reach a " minimum viable credibility " to ensure coverage . Even a strong endorsement might not suffice to have journalists believe you While traditional media is getting conservative , a flurry of viral video channels have appeared . ViralThread , NowThis , Futurism , etc . They love innovative products , and Kickstarter campaigns are prime material for them . They will generally repurpose your video into a 30-seconds clip with bold text overlay for maximum readability . A campaign going viral can evolve from an L or U shape to a " double L " or and " LU . " HAX experience : Various HAX projects , like Octopus , the icon - based watch for kids , got picked up and received millions of views , leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars in new backers . Some channels now have paid options , but results from this have been inconsistent in terms of ROI . Takeaway : Viral channels have grown . Either be lucky , or try to reach out . NowThis picked up the Octopus video ( Source : Kicktraq ) Ads are effective , especially Facebook ads and retargeting with Google AdWords . They work best once your campaign is funded and shows momentum . Because most products take months to ship , this is an important marketing channel to master . If you do n't have time to learn it at first , some specialists can help . Using advertising lifts the rising part of the " U " shape much earlier than for the usual rush in the final days . HAX experience : While our startups only looked seriously into ads about a year ago , some of them have doubled their funding thanks to advertising , with a positive ROI ( i.e. for $ 1 spent they get at least $ 3 or $ 4 , sometimes up to $ 10 -- covering the product costs and generating some profit ) . Takeaway : Ads work ; use them once your campaign has momentum . Revols ramped up ads ( Source : Kicktraq ) Having a community to support your campaign is great . If you haven't been doing it for a while , Facebook ads and good SEO might be your friends . The founder of the smart alarm clock Kello , which raised $ 322,000 on Kickstarter , optimized for both and launched with 10,000 sign - ups , to whom he had asked " How did you wake up today ? , " then " What excites you most about Kello ? " This not only engaged enthusiasts , but helped rank features and refine messaging prior to the launch . Indeed , 700 backed the project in the first two hours , clearing the funding goal . Half of the total funding was collected in the first three days . If your budget is limited , or in addition to gathering your own followers , you can try to leverage " Other People 's Communities . " Online forums , YouTube channels , mommy bloggers , makers , celebrities , cross - promotions with other Kickstarter projects ... the channel and type of community depends on your product . HAX experience : While some of our startups gathered thousands of emails pre - campaign , the conversion rate is often less than 5 percent . With 10,000 emails , that means 500 backers . If your product costs $ 100 , that 's a mere $ 50,000 . Not bad , but not a home run , either . Prynt , which makes a printer case for smartphones , was lucky to have a demo video go viral pre - campaign and gathered more than 60,000 signups . It boosted their launch tremendously . WAZER showed their prototype in various maker events at TechShop , Maker Faire and more . They also created some entertaining videos pre - campaign -- like cutting China out of china and making a batarang --   which helped their launch , as well . Takeaway : A community helps launch your campaign strongly , but you might need extra hands to support it . Prynt leveraged their community for a strong launch ( Source : Kicktraq ) Do n't think the effort stops once you have some initial media coverage . You must make sure backers stick with you , find ways to generate new stories , do some marketing , nurture your community to increase conversions and motivate existing backers to recruit more . Plan for it ! HAX experience : Revols , which makes instant custom - fit earphones , had a full - time person and their campaign ran smoothly , carrying them to $ 2.5 million ( the largest from Canada ) . For Vue , which makes " everyday smart glasses , " all three founders were supporting the campaign during its run , which ended at $ 2.2 million . Despite their great result at $ 1.3 million , WAZER was n't well - prepared to support the campaign post - launch and had to forego some marketing and PR opportunities . You can find this reflected in their campaign data . Takeaway : Get better results and stay sane by having one or more persons dedicated to your campaign . Vue founders dedicated their time fully to the campaign and had a strong finish ( Source : Kicktraq ) Your audience might not be there . Or your product might be something people need to try first . Some product categories , like audio , have done well consistently , but a million - dollar campaign is a rare enough event ( less than 1 percent of all tech campaigns ) to make it hard to predict . HAX experience : We thought some campaigns , like Darma 's " inactivity tracker , " would reach a million , while the founders of Kokoon , which makes headphones for sleep , were hoping to reach $ 250,000 . In both cases , the founders ( and us ) were surprised . Takeaway : A million - dollar campaign is a rare event . Do n't be disappointed ! Not every project is a sustainable or scalable business . Most of the 3D printers that crowdfunded over the past years are likely unable to finance a second production run -- if they even delivered on the first . They are also unlikely to get funding as the technology is now largely commoditized , at least for " Makerbot - type " FDM . If you 're building a startup , crowdfunding should be a tactic to get visibility , gather feedback , identify new customer segments , test your message and possibly fund development , not the whole strategy of the company . Million - dollar campaign or not , smart investors will look at your team , technology and market at least as much as at your crowdfunding result . HAX experience : Remember Makeblock ? The STEM robotics startup raised a modest $ 185,000 in their first campaign in January 2013 . It is worth noting that despite their scale -- Makeblock nowadays employs more than 200 staff -- they keep using Kickstarter to launch new products . They have now used Kickstarter five times successfully , for a total or more than $ 1.6 million . Their latest project , a modular STEM drone , raised $ 830,000 in December 2016 . Takeaway : Kickstarter can be a boost to your finances and credibility , but do n't make it your Plan A.   What is a crowdfunding success ? In our eyes , it is not a million - dollar campaign . It is using shipping a product successfully and preparing your company for the next steps of growth , toward profitability . The next steps -- which might require venture funding or not -- could include online and offline retail ( our Growth program in San Francisco is designed to help with that ) , developing the next version of your product or a totally new one . CHIP , the $ 9 computer , was born out of the need the team had for their hackable GIF camera . The latter raised a mere $ 70,000 , the former raised more than $ 2 million and has now shipped more than 100,000 units . Before you ship , it is an idea . Before profit , it is an experiment . Build a profitable company -- it will set you free .
