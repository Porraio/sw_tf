In 2013 , MIT alums Shireen Yates and Scott Sundvor launched a company called 6SensorLabs with the goal of making going out to eat easier and safer for their fellow food allergy sufferers . Three years later , the startup just raised $ 9.2 million in a Series A financing round and announced that it is changing its name from 6SensorLabs to Nima , the name of its first product . Nima is a portable sensor that tests whether food contains gluten within minutes . " We feel like Nima is much more known to our consumers and for our potential customers . It 's more of our outward facing name , " Yates , the company 's co - founder and CEO , told Entrepreneur . " We wanted to streamline our efforts and really strengthen the brand by merging the two , our corporate identity with our first product . Nima means fair and equitable [ in Persian ] . It really stands for everything that we 're doing in regards to food transparency , giving everyone a chance of enjoying their meal and having that peace of mind . " Now available for purchase on the company 's website , Nima starter kits , which include the sensor , three one - time - use test capsules , a charging cable and carrying case , are priced at $ 279 . Yates and her team are also currently developing tests for peanuts , tree nuts and milk . Nima also makes an accompanying iOS app that shares results with other users , searches for gluten - friendly restaurants and provides scores of restaurants based on reviews from diners .   To date the company has raised $ 14 million from investors such as SK Ventures , Lemnos Labs and Nest founder Matt Rogers .   Yates says that while technology can be compelling , it can only take a company so far . " I recently went back to our original pitch deck . In order to develop something that 's new to the world , that 's a brand new product category , it takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of rigor . You have to make sure you 're making the right product for the consumer . [ With technology ] , you have to really understand if it 's what people want . " Nima is one of many companies that have changed names to better align with customer name recognition . Canada 's Research in Motion rebranded as BlackBerry in 2013 to reflect its well - known mobile devices , while Apple Computer simply   became Apple in 2007 . And back in 1958 , Japanese electronics manufacturer Totsuko changed its named to Sony after the success of its first product , a megaphone . Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com .
