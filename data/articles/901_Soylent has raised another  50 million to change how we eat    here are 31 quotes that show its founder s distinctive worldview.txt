Josh Edelson / Getty ImagesFood - replacement startup Soylent had a wild 2016 . In a bid to go mainstream , the company launched new products like " Coffiest , " its coffee - flavored version , and the " Soylent Bar , " its first solid - food product . But it also had to deal with the fallout from some of its products making consumers violently ill . Soylent ended up temporarily halting some sales . But 2017 appears to be off to a good start , as Soylent just snagged a $ 50 million Series B financing round led by GV ( formerly Google Ventures ) . That brings its total funding to $ 74.5 million . More than the money , however , the new funding affirms that Soylent 's big backers still believe in the company 's vision of the future . Soylent founder Rob Rhinehart , more than perhaps any other founder in the tech world , lives the dream he preaches with Soylent . Before formally launching the food - replacement product , he used his own body to experiment with the recipe . He tinkered with different doses and types of nutrients , sometimes hurting himself in the process . Rhinehart truly believes in hacking food to make something affordable , easy , and sustainable . And he has a very distinct vision of the future of food . We previously put together 31 quotes from Rhinehart that show his view of the world and the future . If you are on his side , they are inspiring and logical . If you are not , they may sound wacky .
