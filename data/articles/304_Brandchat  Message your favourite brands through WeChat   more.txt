A new SA startup , called Brandchat , allows businesses to interact with their customers through multiple messaging platforms such as Facebook , WeChat , Telegram and Kik . " We want to make it as simple and natural to get in touch with a business as it is to get in touch with friends . Starting a chat is quicker than downloading an app , more immediate and cheaper than making a phone call , and simpler than figuring out a complex website , " said Brandchat director , Pete Matthaei in a press release to Ventureburn . Brandchat has developed a " unified dashboard " which allows businesses to create and manage a bot , giving them better control over their customer support and customer feedback time . This also allows businesses to do all customer support across the specified apps . Brandchat has also developed tools which enable businesses to create more engaging content within the chat apps . This function could also give businesses a way to broadcast their special offers , latest news , polls and surveys directly to their customers . " Businesses are now more accessible to their customers . Imagine being able to open your favourite chat app like Facebook Messenger or WeChat , and start a customer support conversation with the business right there . No hold times . No transfers . And it uses little or no airtime , " explained Matthaei . " We all reach for a chat app whenever we want to get in touch with a friend . Now imagine you could do the same when you want to get in touch with a company , " Matthaei continued . According to Matthaei , Brandchat can offer more valuable customer relationships due to their service as well as " consolidated reporting and measurement " . Featured image : Matthew Hurst via Flickr
