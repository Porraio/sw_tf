EveryMove CEO Russell Benaroya shared news of the higi acquisition with GeekWire Wednesday . ( GeekWire Photo )   EveryMove , a Seattle startup that helps employers incentivize employee wellness , has been acquired by health - tracking company higi . Chicago - based higi announced the acquisition as part of a series B investment round led by BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners . That venture fund was also the lead investor in EveryMove 's $ 3.5 million series A back in 2013 . Terms of the deal were not disclosed . " We are excited to be part of a much bigger footprint where our technology can make an impact as part of a broader solution selling into payers and health systems , " said EveryMove CEO Russell Benaroya . " Our partner , Premera Blue Cross , has been instrumental in supporting us to reach an exit . " EveryMove will maintain an office here in Seattle and grow its team , Benaroya said . In 2015 , the startup endured two rounds of layoffs in an attempt to reduce cash burn . EveryMove is a graduate of the Techstars Seattle startup accelerator . Higi operates a network of more than 10,000 health screening stations at grocery and drug stores around the country . Consumers can use the kiosks to get information about their personal health and higi manages that data to provide insights to pharmacists and healthcare providers . The company has collected data from 36 million unique users and also gets wellness information from about 80 connected devices , wearables , and apps . " This investment , along with the integration of EveryMove , further extends higi 's leadership in enabling population health and our ability to help our payer , provider , retail , and brand customers to drive behavior change , cost savings , and improved health , " higi CEO Jeff Bennett said in a press release Wednesday . We 've reached out to EveryMove for additional comments and will update this story when we hear back .
