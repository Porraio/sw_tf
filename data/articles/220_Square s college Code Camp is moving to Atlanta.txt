Five years ago , Square launched a program to guide female high school and college students as they worked toward becoming engineers . More than 140 female college students from across the United States and Canada have gone through the program , with some even joining the company afterward . Square is now changing things up by taking the college version of Code Camp on the road to its Atlanta , Georgia office . The program is now accepting applications from interested students . While Code Camp normally takes place in San Francisco , this is the second time that it 's been held in another city , the first being New York City last year . The company shared that it chose Atlanta because it is interested in supporting the local community , one that 's filled with engineering talent from nearby universities and businesses -- and because it 's also home to quite a few startups and businesses . The Georgia city happens to be one of the first places that Square set up an outpost beyond the Bay Area . Twelve students will be selected to participate in the program , which will take place from August 14 to 19 . While learning about the tech company and developer issues , participants will also have a chance to sit down with Square executives , including chief executive Jack Dorsey and Square Capital and people lead Jacqueline Reses . Mock interviews will be part of the curriculum , in addition to a hackathon and a team project . " Code Camp helped to expose me to new technical concepts that I use in my work at Square , " stated Alyssa Pohahau , a Square engineer who went through Code Camp in 2014 . " Beyond coding skills , one of the most valuable things is the community of diverse women you become a part of . We 've created this community of women who cheer each other on throughout every phase of career development , from college to job interviews to navigating the working world . " Applications are now being accepted through June 1 .
