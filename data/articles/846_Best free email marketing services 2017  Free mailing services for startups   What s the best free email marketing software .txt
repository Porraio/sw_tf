Unlike the others names in this list , SendBlaster provides a more basic model and can only send 100 emails at one time . It does , however , host over 100 email templates and can be easily upgraded to pro for unlimited emails and contact / database lists .   The one - off fee charged for the upgrade is much lower than that of others so should n't be overlooked by smaller businesses that prefer on - premise software . GroupMail and Bigg Mass Mailer are also other good alternatives to this . More information on SendBlaster here .

Upgrading is n't too expensive either with packages starting at $ 7.49 ( PS6 ) per month for a 30,000 monthly email allowance . More information on Mailjet here . Like Mailjet , Constant Contact is n't a totally free product , however , it 's listed because it offers a great free trial . For 60 days free users have access to all of Constant Contact 's marketing tools ( one of the longest trials on the market ) . Constant Contact provides numerous email templates , a drag and drop editor for customisation and excellent email tracking . The next package up from the trial is $ 20 ( PS16 ) per month , so it 's still a reasonable price for small businesses and startups . More information on Constant contact here .
