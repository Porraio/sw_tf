MY - WAY , a Startup Europe project with the goal to help more young adults to become successful web entrepreneurs , just relaunched the MY - WAY map - which was created with the goal to index Europe 's startup ecosystems . It provides aspiring entrepreneurs and young people thinking about starting up with a ton of information and contact details from VCs , angel investors , accelerators , service providers and other players within their local startup scene . The map was created to empower first time entrepreneurs to understand the startup environment not only around them , but throughout Europe , and to help them find the missing piece that enables them to start and grow their business . The MY - WAY team , in which EU - Startups is one of the partners , is continuously updating the map and includes new entities on a regular basis . For the initial launch of the map , the focus was on 10 specific cities only ( Berlin , Brussels , Budapest , Dublin , Istanbul , London , Madrid , Milan , Stockholm , Tel - Aviv ) . But the plan is to really make it a European map and to shine light on all those startup hubs which are not very well documented yet .   Given the large number of vibrant startup hubs in Europe , the team behind MY - WAY is very open to receive hints and suggestions on what organisations to include - especially from smaller startup hubs , since they are n't well represented in the map yet . If you have an addition to the map , please feel free to contact the coordinators of the project via email ( coordinator@mywaystartup.eu ) .
