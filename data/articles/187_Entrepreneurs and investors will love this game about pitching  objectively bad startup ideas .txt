Attention , nerds : This is the party game for you . " Pitch Deck " is kind of like " Cards Against Humanity " for the startup scene -- it takes something terrible ( like enduring a bad business pitch or institutional racism ) and turns it into something hilarious . Players combine a " Company Card " on the table ( like " Tinder for ... " ) with a " Pitch Card " from their hands ( like " Lonely confused men " ) and then everyone makes a quick pitch for their startup . One person plays the investor and decides which company everyone will secretly fund for the round . The person who pitched the most valuable company and the investor who put the most money in that company both win . Pitch Deck , developed by game makers Fred Benenson and Alex Hague , has already surpassed its $ 20,000 fundraising goal on Kickstarter . " Comedy is one of the best ways to critically question our assumptions about the world , " says the Kickstarter . " And even though Pitch Deck is just a goofy card game , it helps explore some of the biases and absurdities inherent in technology and business . " The game is expected to ship in June of this year .
