Though SpaceX had worked to prepare for its first robotic mission to Mars with its Dragon spacecraft in 2018 , Elon Musk 's company will now shoot to make the trip in 2020 . " We felt like we needed to put more resources and focus more heavily on our crew program and our Falcon Heavy program , " SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell explained at a press conference before the company 's successful Falcon 9 launch from Cape Canaveral . " So we 're looking more for the 2020 timeframe for that . " Falcon Heavy , SpaceX 's largest and most weight - bearing rocket , has not been tested yet . The company hopes to use the rocket to launch the Dragon spacecraft on to Mars and test out if the lander can successfully lower itself to the surface . If it works , the spacecraft will be the largest vehicle to arrive on the red planet . Last fall , Musk said he anticipated that the first manned mission to the planet would commence in 2026 and land on Mars in 2027 . Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com .
