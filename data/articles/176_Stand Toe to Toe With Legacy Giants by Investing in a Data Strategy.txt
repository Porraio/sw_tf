Register Now > > While startups seem unable to compete with larger companies thanks to the startup data disadvantage , the data landscape is changing . Kenneth Cukier , data editor for The Economist , pointed out at a November conference that the agility startups enjoy in the early stages of growth can become a hindrance later on once they start competing against larger companies with bigger and better data . But help is on the way : With the rise of data collection services , creatively aligned partnerships and some old - fashioned ingenuity , the " inevitable " failure of data - challenged startups is no longer a looming threat . Startup leaders are n't the type to accept failure readily ; scrappy CEOs are used to taking sometimes unconventional approaches to keeping their businesses alive . Even when that means suspending someone 's salary for a pay cycle or two , the startups that succeed are the ones that find opportunity in every obstacle . For many companies , the availability of capital for vital resources is laid out long before investors come into the picture . Unfortunately , not many see the need to spend money to acquire big data , which can come back to haunt them when it 's time to scale . Just as startups must invest in advertising to spread the word about their products , so must they invest in data to gather insights about their consumers and position themselves for long - term success . For companies looking to box with the heavyweights , a good data strategy is essential . These tips will help growing companies get more from their data and allow them to stand toe to toe with legacy giants : Before spending money on new tools , startups should take a look at their existing arsenal . Many businesses already have access to the vital information they need . Facebook 's Business Manager function provides a treasure trove of information based on ad conversions , likes , shares and comments -- for free . Data is is to be found all over social media interactions . Spending time collecting and analyzing it is one of startups ' most critical priorities when they 're looking to scale . These truths hold especially true for direct company interactions . No like or share should go unscrutinized . Someone within the company should always be on call to evaluate social media interactions in real time , both to collect data and to handle any PR situations that may arise . Before presenting anything to a potential customer , a company must know where in the buying cycle that person currently resides . Some customers might have an immediate need , while others might not even know what the ad is showing them . Whether a potential customer is just becoming aware of the product or is actively looking to make a purchase , the content presented must rely on data to drive the customer to the next phase . In addition , companies can also use Facebook to view their audience profiles for a better understanding of who their users are and what they want . Audience Insights via Facebook Ads Manager is a free tool which , while originally designed for advertisers , can help data - hungry small companies learn more about their audiences -- even when they 're not advertising directly to them . The result will be more effective content and strategies . Most startup CEOs budget their money better than they budget their time . When both money and time go toward the same wrong pursuit , the waste and opportunity costs are doubled . Startups do n't have unlimited time to plot and strategize , so founders can not afford to practice poor time management skills . Budgeting time for data analysis allows companies to give their undivided attention to learning more about their customers -- a pursuit that always bears fruit in the end . Saad Shah , CEO of software company Metric - X LLC , for example , has described how he struggled with time management in the early days of his business . Because the team spent all of its time and energy completing projects , he says , it failed to line up future projects and struggled . Budgeting time , therefore , could have saved money and heartache . From beginning to end , good organizational habits can make the difference between usable data and an overwhelming amount of information . Studies show that employees mimic the habits of leaders , so founders and CEOs must set a good example for those around them . When it comes to cataloging , analyzing and preserving good data , setting that proper example is key . Jonas Downey , Basecamp 's designer , recommends breaking sizable tasks into less overwhelming components to stay organized and productive , as well as maintain the right work environment for each person . Startups do n't need billions of dollars to compete with the big data bullies -- they just need to be smart about their resource management and to practice disciplined data habits to get the most out of what they already have . By following these strategies , entrepreneurs and their companies can go up against anyone with confidence . Daniel Wesley is a Florida - based entrepreneur whose degree is in nuclear medicine .
