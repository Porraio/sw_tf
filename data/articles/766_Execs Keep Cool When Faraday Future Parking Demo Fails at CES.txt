Get Started > > Since its launch in 2014 , transportation startup Faraday Future has been known mostly for stealth and mystery . At CES 2016 , the electric car maker rolled out its concept car , the FFZero1 . This year , the company returned to Las Vegas to unveil its first vehicle that will be available for purchase , the FF 91 -- which you can reserve now if you happen to have a spare $ 5,000 lying around . The company says that the battery - operated car has 12 sensors , 10 HD cameras and can go from zero to 60 mph in 2.39 seconds . It boasts features such as facial recognition , keyless entry , zero - gravity seats , high - speed internet and the ability to park itself . But that last one caused some trouble at Faraday 's big CES presentation this week . Halfway through the hour presentation , Hong Bae , Faraday Future 's director of ADAS ( advanced driving assistance systems ) and self - driving took to the stage to demonstrate the FF 91 's driverless valet feature , with a backdrop behind him that said " never worry about parking again . " " Imagine you have a very important meeting to go to and you are running late . You rush to the office and the parking lot looks full . You do n't have 10 , 15 minutes to look for a space , " Bae said , setting the scene . " Would n't it be great if you could just come out of the car , bring your phone out , activate self - parking and the vehicle starts driving itself and looking for a parking spot ? " In the parking lot , the car 's performance was a little plodding , but it successfully backed into the spot selected by John Jay Lee , the mayor of North Las Vegas who was on hand to help do the honors . However , the car 's big reveal onstage left a little to be desired . Jia Yueting , a Chinese billionaire who is Faraday 's main investor , drove up amid music and flashing lights . When Yueting hopped out of the car , Nick Sampson , the company 's senior vice president of research and development , prompted him to press the button that would initiate the car 's self - parking feature . And then nothing happened .   The mishap was certainly embarrassing , especially given all the hype leading up to the big moment . Faraday has designs on rivaling Tesla , right down to poaching that company 's former employees . It also was in the news this fall when work had to be stopped on its $ 1 billion factory in Nevada ( though construction is slated to commence again this year ) . Sometimes glitches and mistakes happen , but the Faraday leaders remained composed , kept things moving and said what they wanted to say , even though the outcome was n't ideal .
