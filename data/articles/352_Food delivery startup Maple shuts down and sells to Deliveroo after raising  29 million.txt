Another food delivery startup dies . Manhattan - based Maple , a startup that prepared and delivered meals without the help of restaurants , is shutting down after launching nearly two years ago and raising $ 29 million from Thrive , Greenoaks , and New York food deity David Chang . Not long after its launch , Maple was touted as " insanely efficient " and " Chipotle - crushing , " but documents leaked last year showed the business was burning cash with every meal it moved . Maple announced its shutdown in New York -- its sole market -- in an email to customers today . At the end of its letter , the company said " some members of the Maple team will join Deliveroo , " a U.K. restaurant delivery service similar to U.S .- based Grubhub . " Our technology will be used to help accelerate growth and efficiency across the platform , " the letter said .
