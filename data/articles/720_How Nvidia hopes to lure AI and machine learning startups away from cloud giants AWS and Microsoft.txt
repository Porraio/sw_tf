Nvidia , the graphics processing unit specialist , is looking to attract startups working with machine learning technology to opt for their hardware over cloud providers like Microsoft and AWS , in a land grab for the lucrative niche of AI startups . Startups building products on top of cutting edge artificial intelligence ( AI ) technology require a huge amount of computing power in order to process large amounts of data , which is expensive . Cloud giants like Microsoft , Google and Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) have traditionally given away thousands of dollars in credits for startups to court them onto their platforms . This can pay huge dividends if you manage to get a Snapchat or Airbnb onto your services early on , as shown by Snap 's $ 1 billion commitment to AWS over the next five years . For AI - focused companies these credits could be put towards running graphics processing units ( GPUs ) - which are better than traditional CPUs at processing large amounts of data - on their virtual machines in the cloud at a discount . This is extremely useful for the kind of compute - intensive modelling that is required in the background for companies using machine and deep learning techniques . Now , the GPU manufacturer Nvidia is going head to head with the cloud giants with its Inception Program , in a drive to court the best AI startups directly onto their hardware . Jack Watts , startup business manager at Nvidia explained to Techworld that the aim of the programme , which was launched last summer , is " nurturing those startups and helping them get access to hardware and marketing lift with us , but really the whole thing is about driving this community of startups which are doing weird and wonderful things with AI and Nvidia GPUs . " Members can apply for GPU hardware grants and will be invited to try the latest software and hardware , such as the Nvidia Deep Learning SDK , Digits deep learning GPU training System and the GPU Inference Engine . Nvidia also provides startups with access to expertise , so they can speak to solution architects to ask questions about which hardware would be best for a specific project ( the answer probably being Nvidia ) , or for advice on certain frameworks or cloud providers . Members also get access to the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute ( DLI ) , with credits going towards training courses .   Startups will get the chance to catch the eye of Nvidia 's ventures programme , called GPU Ventures , which got good returns on an investment in mobile game developer NaturalMotion , a company that was acquired by Zynga for $ 527 million in 2014 . The part that will really grab startup founder 's attention though is the discounted hardware . The Nvidia DGX-1 supercomputer , for example , can provide 2 - 3 times performance improvements over other GPU options in the market and is available to Inception members at rates comparable to that given to academic institutions . The problem is that a DGX-1 retails for PS178,000 , so balancing that sort of capital expenditure ( capex ) against the operational expenditure ( opex ) of spinning up virtual machines in the cloud is a tricky proposition for startups . This is exactly the issue that UK AI startup Onfido has been grappling with since joining the 80 or so UK startups on the Inception programme . Speaking to Techworld , Rahul Amin , CTO and cofounder of the identify verification startup said that it is " hard " to decide when to buy hardware against spinning up instances in the cloud , and that they currently do a combination of the two . " We probably haven't found the right balance yet , " he said .   Onfido uses machine learning to verify government issued documents for employers and sharing economy platforms that are increasingly keen to verify users and cut down on fraud . Which means Amin understands the importance of GPUs to his core business as well as anyone . " GPUs have been a fundamental part of this process for doing machine learning " , he said . " We started off with a singular machine with a gaming graphics card , as a startup it was all about being efficient . We started to train models for extracting text from a document and as the company grew we have introduced various servers and each development machine has GPUs in them . " Cost is the main issue for a startup though , even one as well funded ( PS25 million to date ) as Onfido . " It has always been a concern how much we spend on GPUs , " Amin said . " If you spin up a machine in the cloud it is going to cost you if you run it for a long time , so balancing what is the best way to train models has been an interesting decision and a conversation we continually have in terms of optimising our hardware and providing engineers with the right level of hardware .
