You know what they say : Talk sh*t , get proverbially hit . Co - founder and co - CEO of Australian startup Atlassian had to issue a Twitter - blow to the nation 's immigration minister on Wednesday night , after the politician started running his mouth off."Wow ... did I just get trolled by a govt minister as being un - Australian ? " tech billionaire Mike Cannon - Brookes wrote on Twitter after reading about the comments . And thus began a casual take down . SEE ALSO : ' Irresponsible and irrational : ' Aussie startups speak out on Muslim ban On TV program Today , hosts interviewed politician Peter Dutton to discuss the axing ( and eventual replacement ) of Australia 's 457 program , which allowed skilled migrants to temporarily live and work in Australia."Do you know of Mike Cannon - Brookes ? " the host asked . " I think he is the co - founder of Atlassian . His tech company is bigger than Qantas . He said to The Australian that 457 Visas were essential for Australia and any move to make bridging the talent gap more difficult would be bad for the country."The minister responded , " Well let 's have a look at what work they 're doing in the local market . How many young Australians are they employing ? Are they going into schools looking for young kids to come and work in jobs ? Are they employing mature aged workers who have found themselves out of a job elsewhere ? Let 's have a look at the details."Cannon - Brookes was bemused , if frustrated . Wow ...   did I just get trolled by a govt minister as being un - Australian ? https://t.co/tM9Qxs3het - this bullshit makes me mad ... -- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017Firstly ... I haven't given any quotes on 457s recently , so any attributions are from old articles ( Nov 2016 ? ) on " abolishing 457s " ... https://t.co / OiQe87IqLS-- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017As far as I can read so far ... 457s have been named - changed with a remarkably similar program ? ( which actually looks quite good ? ) ... https://t.co / yHPWzhW8th-- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017They removed occupations like actor , blacksmith , deer farmer , golfer , goat farmer & zookeeper   @Atlassian does n't hire a lot of those ... https://t.co / p4CYttOhUt-- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017(One might wryly comment there 's an unaustralian joke in removing betting agency managers , shearers , jockeys and dog / horse trainers ? ) ... https://t.co / R4lN9xMzNz-- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017The tightenings in rules put in place actually look quite sensible to me ( full reading coming soon ) ? ... https://t.co/3osZMxrYZG-- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017Yep , his quotes were old and entirely irrelevant to the dismantling of the visa program . But because he 's up there with Elon Musk when it comes to Twitter shade ( that 's why they love some banter ) , Cannon - Brookes did n't stop there . Oh no . He responded directly to Dutton 's questioning , listing just what they 've done for the country 's workforce as well as taking aiming at the arguably Trump - esque , nationalistic rhetoric the government used to announce the changes . And @PeterDutton_MP trolling ? Us :   Jobs created ? 1000 + . Grads hired ? 100s . Scholarships ? 100s . Kids CS classes ? 1000sYou : ? # BringItOn https://t.co / AYRdRTKI2x-- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017Our default position _ is _ to see out an Australian for a job first ... because it 's cheaper and faster to do so . It just makes sense . ... https://t.co / C1O3GpT43n-- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017But when the experience required is n't here , we need a program . That 's what the 457 did & the new program aims to do . Great ... https://t.co / hMvM1UlzSH-- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017This " new program " seems to remove large categories of jobs which are nothing to do with tech - industries without those shortages . Great . https://t.co/0MeB6Zkn4Z-- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017Let 's separate nationalism and logic . This program seems logical . The " Australia first " Trumpy crap adds nothing but hot air . https://t.co / Pd0mD3dibj-- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017And the irony of writing this when here is my current view . Count all 6 of them . # hopawaytrolls https://t.co/qfHLF0E9J1 pic.twitter.com / xnFt7UflOy-- Mike Cannon - Brookes ( @mcannonbrookes ) April 19 , 2017And just for some additional LOLs , Cannon Brookes also shared a couple of bits of choice Twitter commentary . One from a guy know how to hit a politician right where it hurts -- in the offshore immigration detention facilities . And , one from a guy who found work at Atlassian , while he was still in school . He 's got you well and truly beat when it comes to offshore prison camps though . https://t.co / A0aLx1foyG-- Will McDougall ( @WillMcDougall ) April 19 , 2017@mcannonbrookes " Are they going into schools looking for young kids to go and work in jobs?"Yes . In 2007 , Atlassian was my first job while I was studying.-- Chris Broadfoot ( @broady ) April 19 , 2017In conclusion , never stop tweeting , Mike Cannon - Brookes . Never stop tweeting .
