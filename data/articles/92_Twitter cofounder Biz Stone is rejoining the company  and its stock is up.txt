Twitter cofounder Biz Stone . APAfter almost six years away , Biz Stone is rejoining Twitter , the social network he cofounded -- news that sent Twitter 's stock popping up by almost 2.5% at the time of writing . Stone disclosed the news in a blog post on Medium . " My top focus will be to guide the company culture , that energy , that feeling , " Stone wrote in his post . " I 'm not replacing anyone at Twitter . Somebody mentioned I 'm just filling the ' Biz shaped hole ' I left . " You might even say the job description includes being Biz Stone . " Stone will retain his role at Pinterest as an adviser to chief product officer Evan Sharp , a Pinterest representative told Business Insider . Stone departed Twitter in June 2011 , a move that left the company without any of its original founders , which also included Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey , on board . His exit followed a tumultuous period of infighting among the trio and Dorsey 's ouster as CEO . Fast forward to 2017 : Dorsey has been back in Twitter 's CEO seat for two years . Stone recently sold the human - powered search engine Jelly , his latest startup , to Pinterest for an undisclosed sum . And now , with Stone having mended fences with Dorsey , he wrote that he 's ready to return to the company he cofounded . Stone rejoins Twitter at a critical moment for the company . While its service has found itself at the center of global politics , its new - user growth has stalled , leaving Wall Street lukewarm on its stock . Still , a recent earnings report painted a rosy picture for the future of the company , even as it moves toward live video to bolster its growth .
