Amalgam Rx A new startup called Amalgam Rx wants to change the way people with type 2 diabetes manage their insulin intake with the help of a prescription app . There are roughly 30 million people in the US living with diabetes , many of whom inject insulin , a hormone that 's produced in healthy bodies to control blood sugar levels . For many people living with diabetes -- including the 1.25 million people in the US who have Type-1 diabetes -- injecting insulin is part of the daily routine . In particular , it 's the group of people who have type 2 and are just starting to use insulin that the startup , founded by a pair of siblings who also founded another digital therapeutics company WellDoc , wants to help . Ryan Sysko , Amalgam Rx CEO , told Business Insider that when a patient starts using insulin , the doctor often prescribes a low dose to see how their body reacts . A patient might stay on that dose , which could be too low to really do anything , until their next visit . Instead , Sysko , along with his sister , Amalgam 's chief medical officer Dr. Suzanne Clough , developed an algorithm to help people increase their insulin doses as needed . The FDA - cleared , prescription iSage Rx app launched on Monday . The goal , Sysko said , is to use the app to accelerate the process of getting blood sugar levels into the target healthy range , which is a key part of managing diabetes . Amalgam Rx 's iSage Rx app is one of a few so - called " insulin titration " apps out there , and it 's part of a growing movement to use software to treat diseases alongside ( or occasionally instead of ) traditional methods . Eventually , Amalgam Rx wants to expand beyond diabetes to other disease areas , ideally partnering with pharmaceutical companies to create app - medication combinations . So far , the company 's raised less than $ 1 million in seed funding .
