Facebook / Jinn On demand delivery startup Jinn has raised $ 10 million ( PS7.8 million ) in venture funding , bringing total investment in the company up to $ 20 million ( PS15.5 million ) , TechCrunch reports . Jinn , which operates an app that allows people to get things delivered from restaurants like McDonald 's and shops , reportedly received the money from STE Capital , Samaipata Ventures , and other previous investors . The London - based company intends to use the funding to grow in its existing markets as opposed to expanding to new ones , according to TechCrunch . Jinn made headlines in January when dozens of its couriers went on strike over changes to their pay . Leon Herrera , Jinn 's cofounder and chief operating officer ( COO ) , was heckled and told he was a " thief " when he confronted the protestors on the street . " You 're treating us like slaves , " one of the protesters shouted at Herrera .
