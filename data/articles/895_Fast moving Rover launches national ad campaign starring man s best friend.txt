Rover is rolling out its biggest ad campaign ever . ( Screenshot via YouTube ) .   Rover is growing up fast and learning some new tricks along the way . The Seattle startup is rolling out its first national ad campaign today to promote its dog walking and sitting marketplace .   Rover says it 's now the largest dog care network in the country with more than 100,000 sitters and 75,000 dog walkers . Rover beefed up its network by acquiring its top competitor , DogVacay , for an undisclosed sum in March .   Thanks to that growth , Rover is planning to spend $ 4.5 million on marketing and advertisement this year . The national campaign launching today is Rover 's biggest media investment to date . By offering services in cities across the U.S. and Canada , Rover and DogVacay generated over $ 150 million in bookings in 2016 . Last year , Rover raised $ 40 million in what CEO Aaron Easterly said could be its last round of fundraising before going public . " Our goal with this campaign is to show pet parents that Rover can help them find true dog people who will care for their dog the same way they would ... We 're a community of dog people in every sense , from our sitters , to the pet parents we serve , to the Rover employees , and this campaign is reflective of that , " said Halle Hutchison , vice president of marketing for Rover .
