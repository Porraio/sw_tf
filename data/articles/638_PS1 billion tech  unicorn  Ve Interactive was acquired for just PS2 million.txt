Ve Interactive 's new CEO Martin Tonnesen . Ve Interactive Ve Interactive , once considered a UK tech " unicorn " worth at least PS1 billion , was sold to its management for just PS2 million , according to an update from one of its investors . Media and tech investor Concha , which paid PS4 million for a 0.43% stake in Ve Interactive last March , issued an update to its shareholders where it said its board was " deeply disappointed " by the company 's decline in recent months . It said the value of its investment in Ve Interactive had been " eliminated . " Concha wrote in its update : " [ As ] part of a pre - packaged arrangement , the business and assets of Ve were sold to Rowchester Limited for a cash consideration of PS2 m , payable in instalments over a 12 month period ending April 2018 . " Concha has previously said it and other shareholders were considering a challenge to the deal . In its update , the company added that it would " continue to investigate the actions of those responsible for its demise . " Ve Interactive is an online ad business that was once billed as a successful UK startup , but went into administration last month after failing to raise PS20 million in new funding . Its founding CEO David Brown stepped down in March , and the company went into administration in April . Its core business was rescued by its management team in a pre - pack administration deal , leaving appointed administrators Smith & Williamson to find a way to pay off Ve 's creditors . The buyout was led by a consortium called Rowchester Limited , which is made up of Ve Interactive 's new management team . That includes new CEO Martin Tonnessn and COO David Marrinan - Hayes . The Telegraph reported last month that Ve Interactive owed PS1.3 million in tax before its collapse .
