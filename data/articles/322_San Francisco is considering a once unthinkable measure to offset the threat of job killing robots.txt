San Francisco County Supervisor Jane Kim addresses a crowd during a " Yes on Prop 61 " rally outside City Hall in 2016 . Josh Edelson / AP The tech industry collectively face - palmed when Trump 's treasury secretary said earlier this year that the threat of robots taking human jobs was " not even on our radar screen . " There is a growing evidence that robots and artificial intelligence could displace huge swaths of the American workforce in the next couple of decades , much sooner than the " 50 to 100 more years away " timeline that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expects . In San Francisco , where robots already run food deliveries for Yelp 's Eat24 and make lattes at a mall coffee kiosk , one politician is working to ensure the city stays ahead of the curve . Supervisor Jane Kim is exploring a tax on robots as one solution to offset the economic devastation a robot - powered workforce might bring . Companies that use robots to perform tasks previously done by humans would pay the city . Those public funds might be used to help retrain workers who lose their jobs to robots or to finance a basic income initiative . Kim , one of 11 city supervisors in San Francisco , has been interviewing tech leaders , labor groups , and public policy experts in the hopes of creating a task force that will explore how a " robot tax " might be implemented . San Francisco would become the first city to create such a tax , after European lawmakers rejected a similar proposal in February . " We think that [ automation of work ] could be one of the bigger -- or biggest -- policy issues that will face us in , not the next 50 to 100 years , as Mnuchin said , but in the next five to 10 years . And I think that government needs to get ahead of the curve , " Kim tells Business Insider .

Cafe X Technologies Kim learned the concept of a robot tax when Bill Gates called for one in an interview with Quartz . It struck a chord with the San Francisco politician , who represents some of the poorest and wealthiest residents across the Tenderloin , South of Market , Civic Center , Treasure Island , and several other neighborhoods . She hears of robots cropping up in hotels , hospitals , and even her local bar , and worries about how automation might deepen the income gap . A new study from research fim PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) estimates 38% of US jobs could be lost to automation by the early 2030s . Jobs that are repetitive and do not require human interaction -- like flipping burgers or making deliveries -- are likely to be the first to swap out people for robots . The disruption will hurt low - income earners first , Kim predicts . San Francisco has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the US , according to figures from the Brookings Institute . Sam Altman , president of startup accelerator Y Combinator , has said automation will bring " a change in the economy on the order of the Industrial Revolution or the Agricultural Revolution , where you see a huge amount of human jobs change in a very short period of time . " On - demand food delivery startup DoorDash relies on a fleet of six - wheeled couriers to make deliveries in Redwood City , California . Starship Technologies When Kim hears tech workers talk about automation , she says they often put a positive spin on the displacement . " No one 's going to have to work at McDonald 's anymore , " they tell her . " That wealth will accumulate among a very few due to automation , " she says . " [ So the question is , ] what do we do with that accumulated wealth that 's being distributed to fewer people ? " A robot tax could potentially give the city of San Francisco the ability to channel those savings into a fund that helps low - income workers make a living . The Office of Economic and Workforce Development already provides training in healthcare , hospitality , construction , and technology to residents who face barriers to employment , like a lack of higher education . The tax might also provide funds for a universal basic income experiment , such as the one currently underway in Oakland , California . The program gives roughly 100 families $ 2,000 a month to live on , and has racked up some impressive supporters from Silicon Valley . This is n't the first time a robot tax has been floated in the US . In 1940 , a US senator suggested a tax on machines to offset the unemployment they may cause . It was called an " economic monstrosity " that has " no chance whatsoever of congress [ sic ] ever enacting it into law . " A robot from startup Savioke makes a room - service delivery at a hotel in Silicon Valley . Savioke When Gates resurfaced the idea in February , internet commenters took to Twitter in protest . Most tech leaders have been quiet on the issue . The CEO of robotics startup Savioke , whose robots deliver fresh towels and coffee at hotels across the region , compared the tax to an " innovation penalty " in an editorial . Ulrich Spiesshofer of European automation - technology solutions company ABB Group also attacked the proposal in an interview with CNBC . " Taxing robotics is as intelligent as taxing software , " Spiesshofer said . " They are both productivity tools . You should not tax the tools , you should tax the outcome that 's coming . " Kim made clear that she is in the beginning stages of assembling a group that will explore solutions for automation . San Francisco is a long way from seeing a robot tax implemented . " I do think it 's important that we 're the city that looks at this issue , because we 're at the center of the technological revolution . We have access to so many academics , researchers , and tech companies that can help us brainstorm and think about this issue , " Kim says . " And why not ? DC 's not thinking about it . "
