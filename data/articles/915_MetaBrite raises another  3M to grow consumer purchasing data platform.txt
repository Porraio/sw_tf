MetaBrite is raising more cash to bolster its receipt - scanning and business intelligence technology . The Seattle startup just reeled in an additional $ 3 million from existing investors and Acorn Ventures . Total funding to date is now $ 16 million . Docusign co - founder Court Lorenzini heads up MetaBrite as CEO . He originally raised nearly $ 5 million for CookBrite , which was the name of his company that built a one - stop mobile meal - planning solution , acting as a digital shopping list and recipe book . But in November 2015 , the startup changed its name to MetaBrite , expanding its focus toward a business intelligence platform . Now the company is committing 100-percent to the new platform and will shut down the existing CookBrite app later this month . MetaBrite has developed machine learning technology that can scan receipts and automatically extract precise item - level details from any retailer . It licenses its receipt processing SDK into multiple consumer - facing apps . " Our application partners cover a wide variety of consumer use cases including brand loyalty and reward programs , lifestyle apps , and mobile consumer research to name a few , " Lorenzini told GeekWire . There are now 30 people working for MetaBrite , up from 18 this time last year . Sam Lucente , who co - founded the company with Lorenzini , is no longer part of the executive team but still sits on the board . The startup also recently hired two new execs : Former Amazon manager Leigh Allen - Arredondo as director of design , and former Blackberry exec Mark Meuleman as vice president of business development . Other MetaBrite executives include Roy Penn , a former engineer with the Israeli Defense Forces ; and Christine McKee , a former RealNetworks and Expedia executive . Other employees have experience at places like Kraft , McDonalds , IBM , and Nielsen .
