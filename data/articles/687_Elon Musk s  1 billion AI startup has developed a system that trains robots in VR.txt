Elon Musk . TED OpenAI , the artificial intelligence research company set up by Elon Musk , has come up with a new method for teaching robots -- giving them a demo in virtual reality . The non - profit , which is funded to the tune of $ 1 billion , trained a self - learning algorithm to complete a task after a human demonstrated it once in virtual reality . In this case , the task was stacking coloured blocks . The team got a programmed robot to reproduce the behaviour shown during the demonstration in the virtual environment . " We 've developed and deployed a new algorithm , one - shot imitation learning , allowing a human to communicate how to do a new task by performing it in VR , " OpenAI wrote in a blog post on Tuesday . OpenAI The company explained that the algorithm is powered by two neural networks , which are computer systems based on the human brain . One of the neural networks is a vision network and the other is an imitation network . The vision network is trained with hundreds of thousands of simulated images with different combinations of lighting , textures , and objects , while the imitation network " observes a demonstration , processes it to infer the intent of the task , and then accomplishes the intent starting from another starting configuration . " While the algorithm was successfully taught how to stack blocks on this occassion , OpenAI said the same technique could be applied to other tasks .
