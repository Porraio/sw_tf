Chris Neumann , general partner , 500 Startups   It 's really hard to take a deep technology idea and nurture that idea until it grows into a real business , especially with the pressures of modern tech venture capital . 500 Startups thinks it can make that process a little easier . Starting this July , 500 Startups will launch a data - startup oriented track for startups working on big data and machine learning problems . Chris Neumann , who had been advising 500 Startups on this topic since January as entrepreneur - in - residence , is now joining the incubator as a venture partner and will lead the track . " The current model does n't work for enterprise data companies , " said Neumann , who founded DataHero and sold it to Portland - based Cloudability last year . " Maybe it takes longer than 18 months to build your MVP ( minimum viable product ) , and once you layer on top of that enterprise sales cycles , it turns into something very different " than experienced by the consumer - facing social media apps so popular among incubators and venture capitalists over the last few years . Also , founders of deep technology companies tend to be , well , immersed in deep technology problems and less aware of what it takes to turn a product demo into a customer pilot and eventually a sales commitment , Neumann said . VCs wo n't fund small companies until they 've demonstrated at least some traction , and first - time founders with great tech ideas often need help getting the business part off the ground . 500 Startups will bring in several advisers to help startups in this track , and applications can be submitted here . Editor 's Note : This post was updated with Neumann 's correct title .
