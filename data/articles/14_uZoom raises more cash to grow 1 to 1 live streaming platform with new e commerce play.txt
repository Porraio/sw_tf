John Kueber . ( uZoom Photo )   uZoom is raising more cash as it builds out its 1-to-1 live video streaming platform and expands into e - commerce . The Seattle startup has reeled in an additional $ 1.5 million from Broadmark Capital and angel investors . uZoom , which raised a $ 560,000 seed round last year , launched this past June with its marketplace for live streaming video , connecting people who want to see something in the world with those on the ground that are actually there . For example , during last year 's Summer Olympics , uZoom provided a way for people to use their smartphones to live - stream from a bevy of locations -- swimming competitions , late night festivities , beaches , etc . -- and give viewers from around the world an alternate method to see what was going on in Brazil .   The idea is that people will pay a nominal fee to see something streamed live by a " Zoomer , " with uZoom providing the platform to make it happen . " Whether you 're curious about what it 's like to go out to dinner in Japan or you 'd like a first - hand look at an elk hunt in Montana , uZoom is a platform full of new experiences and opportunities through live streaming , " the site reads . Some of the top categories on uZoom include " street tours , " " neighborhood advice , " " current events , " " local sports , " and more . Originally founded by digital media vet Martin Rincon , uZoom tapped Dean Graziano as its CEO last year . This past November , Graziano stepped down and was replaced by digital media veteran John Kueber , who was previously at Jrrny.com . Kueber told GeekWire that uZoom continues to raise more money that will be used to fund its consumer platform as well as " another initiative related to shopping / e - commerce that will be announced in the coming weeks . " Here 's a shopping - related video the company recently posted that may signal what 's in store :   uZoom employs eight people and has raised $ 2 million to date .
