BluHaptics demonstrates how to use its software to control a robotic arm underwater . ( BluHaptics Image )   Telerobotics startup BluHaptics has raised $ 1.36 million to launch its first commercial product this summer and expand the domain of its robotic control software from the deep sea to deep space . Seattle Angel Fund led the latest funding round with participation from Seattle 's Alliance of Angels . Seattle - based BluHaptics , which spun out of the University of Washington in 2013 , builds software to improve communication between pilots and remotely operated vehicles underwater . Since its launch , the company has received more than $ 1 million in government grants . CEO Don Pickering told GeekWire that his company has begun onboarding early customers , and recently did a test " with a major oil and gas company . " Pickering said the test went well . " We are getting almost unanimous positive response on the software , " he said . BluHaptics is also looking at where it can take its software next , with its next move being literally out of this world . Pickering said BluHaptics is using some of the new money to expand into the space robotics market . " We 're getting strong interest in space applications for running robots remotely in space as well as terrestrial applications , including service robots and even aerial drones , of all things , " Pickering said . " Robots do really well in a factory environment , where everything can be programmed with a high degree of accuracy because everything is known . But when you take a robot into the field or use it remotely , it becomes incredibly challenging . " That 's where BluHaptics comes in . Their devices use force - feedback control systems and 3-D displays to let customers control robots more easily and efficiently . The software can be used with oil rigs , excavation tools -and soon , with satellites and drones . Pickering said the company , which currently has six full - time and two part - time employees , is continually applying for patents . BluHaptics was awarded two patents last fall , and another four are pending . The company 's application for underwater manipulator arms will release in June . " We are as excited about the management team they have put in place as we are about their groundbreaking technology , " Seattle Angel Fund 's Susan Preston said in a statement . " We believe BluHaptics is well poised to transform the telerobotics market . "
