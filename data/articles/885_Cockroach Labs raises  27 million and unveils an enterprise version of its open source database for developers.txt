Cockroach Labs , which provides an open source database for developers , announced today the launch of an enterprise offering , as well as funding of $ 27 million . Redpoint Ventures led the round , with Benchmark Capital , FirstMark Capital , GV , and Index Ventures returning as investors . " We are offering what is going to become the new standard -- ' multi - active availability ' , " wrote Cockroach Labs ' founder and CEO , Spencer Kimball , in an email to VentureBeat . " It means multiple servers have replicas of your data , and there are new protections in place to ensure that in the event of failover , applications built on top of the database will not experience potentially damaging inconsistencies . " The startup 's name is a tribute to a cockroach 's resiliency . Kimball argues that while databases offered by private clouds like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) may offer similar features , Cockroach Labs ' product has the advantage of flexibly spanning different clouds in hybrid deployments and migrating between clouds without downtime . " This means no vendor lock - in , which is a dangerous problem when you 're entrusting all of your data to one vendor , " he wrote in an email to VentureBeat . CockroachDB Enterprise is available starting today through a paid subscription model for customers with larger data sets . The subscription includes incremental backup / restore and support , and the startup claims to already have notable customers in production , including Baidu . Cockroach Labs will use today 's funding to further develop its products , increase customer support , and make additional hires . Founded in 2015 , the New York City - based startup has 30 employees and has raised a total of $ 53.5 million to date .
