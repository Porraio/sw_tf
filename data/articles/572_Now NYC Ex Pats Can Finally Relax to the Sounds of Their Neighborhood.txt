Everyone loves the environment they grew up in or spent their formative years in . For me , that 's my hometown of Seattle . We haven't had a week without rain since September , and I love it . But the U.S. city with the biggest , most outsized rep for ex - pat love is the Big Apple itself . And as of today , those pining for a taste of New York City finally have a chance to soak in a little of their favorite neighborhood . Workspace startup Breather is offering a web app that curates the sounds of New York City : The online app Sounds of New York holds mastered clips recorded in 27 neighborhoods , from Times Square to Chinatown . It 's an immersive example of the unique aspects of the city : Harlem has notes of jazz , while parts of Nolita were recorded at the Supreme store . Better yet , it 's an interesting look at the creative storytelling that a startup can lean on in order to call attention to their services . I spoke with Vanda Daftari , Head of Creative at Breather , to learn more about the ambient noise app : " This is our approach to content , " Vanda told me . " At Breather , we 're focusing on making things that people use and love , and we feel that our content should be no different . "   What are Breather 's goals for the service ? " Breather is all about helping you find your focus as humanly as possible -- now through the medium of audio , " Vanda explained . " Sounds of New York provides an ambient noise soundtrack for you to play in the background while you 're working . We just happened to curate these particular background sounds from famous locations throughout NYC neighborhoods , to create a tribute to a city we love . " I love the booming podcast industry , and ambient noise is an interesting yet often overlooked aspect of the non - music audio world . Here 's hoping Breather keeps exploring new soundscapes in the future ! Read more about the podcast sector here at Tech . Co .
