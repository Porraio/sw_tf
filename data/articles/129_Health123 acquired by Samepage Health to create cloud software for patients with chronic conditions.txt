Samepage Health has acquired Health123 , a Seattle - based startup that launched in 2011 and created a healthcare intelligence management platform . Founded by University of Washington professor Paul Ciechanowski , Samepage has been around for several years and sells online tools to help professionals treat patients with multiple behavior health and medical conditions . The idea is to reduce money that delivery networks , medical groups and payers spend on complex chronic patients , while improving the quality of the care . Now Samepage will utilize Health123 's platform . Health123 co - founder Rebecca Norlander , a former Microsoft executive , is now CEO of Samepage . Her two colleagues , CTO Walt Jones and COO Rachel Lanham , will also join the company , which will employ around 10 people after the acquisition . Norlander said the Health123 platform can be a " force multiplier " for Samepage 's existing Samepage Method product , which is used by clients like Mayo Clinic , NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation , and Trinity Health . " Samepage has built a vibrant services - based business , but wants to take it to the next level with technology to create the one - two punch of services powered by scalable platform technologies -- that 's where Health123 comes in , " Norlander told GeekWire . Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed . " We are thrilled to welcome Health123 's talented and innovative leadership and personnel to join the Samepage team , " Ciechanowski said in a statement . " By leveraging their proven platform , we will be able to bring our successful solution to more customers quickly , and more deeply engage patients on their terms while better supporting clinicians .
