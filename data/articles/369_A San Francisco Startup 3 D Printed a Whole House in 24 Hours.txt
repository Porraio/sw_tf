San Francisco - based startup Apis Cor built a whole house in a Russian town within 24 hours . It did n't repair an existing home or use prefabricated parts to make that happen -- the secret lies in 3-D printing . The company used a mobile 3-D printer to print out the house 's concrete walls , partitions and building envelope . Workers had to manually paint it and install the roofing materials , wiring , hydro - acoustic and thermal insulation , but that did n't take much time . The result is a 400-square - foot house that 's around as big as a standard hotel room . It 's no mansion , but it could prove attractive to the growing contingent of people who prefer tiny homes . Apis Cor says the whole house cost about $ 10,134 make , with the door and windows eating up the largest part of the budget . That sounds about right for a tiny home , though that probably does n't account for the cost of land . The company uploaded a video of the process you can watch below . It even shows what the interior looks like with appliances , including a curved TV that fits the house 's curved wall , provided by Samsung . If Apis Cor does start 3-D printing houses , owners can choose any shape they want and even choose to make one larger than this compact abode .     Mariella Moon is an associate editor at Engadget .
