Business Insider / Sam SheadApple 's mysterious office in Berlin has been located by Business Insider . The discrete office is on the second floor of Markgrafenstrasse 34 , which overlooks the famous Gendarmenmarkt square in the centre of Berlin . The office , which Apple has never publicly confirmed the existence of , was linked to the highly secretive Apple Car project last April and its location has been a mystery until now . There are no Apple logos to be seen but the company does have its name next to a tiny buzzer outside the building 's main door . Apple did not respond to Business Insider 's request for comment . It was n't easy and it 's taken several months of asking around . Apple did not respond to us on several occasions and more than a dozen Berliners working in the city 's tech industry said they had no idea that Apple had an office in the city when Business Insider asked them about it . Google Maps Eventually , a source in the Berlin startup scene told us that Apple has an office near Gendarmenmarkt -- arguably Berlin 's most magnificent square -- but they declined to give us the exact address . They did , however , give us one more clue by saying it was close to Einstein Kaffee , which is a coffee shop on the corner of Gendarmenmarkt . When we visited Einstein Kaffee on Tuesday , a barrista told us that the Apple office was next door on the second floor . Apple 's name and logo are missing from the second floor slot on the sign in the window but the company does have its name next to a little door buzzer that 's easy to miss . Gendarmenmarkt square is home to the Konzerthaus ( concert hall ) and the French and German churches . Wikimedia Commons No sign of Apple on this sign . Business Insider / Sam Shead We asked a man leaving the building if Apple was indeed inside and he confirmed that the tech giant quietly moved in around a year ago . He said he was n't sure how many people Apple had in the office because the elevators only take people to the floor that their key cards have access to . We then called Apple 's camera - equipped buzzer three times but got no answer . As we stood outside , blinds were lowered over the windows of the Apple office , possibly to prevent us photographing any confidential company information that may have been visible on the walls inside . The Apple buzzer . Business Insider / Sam Shead It 's all a bit of a mystery but it 's possible to make some educated guesses based on previous reports . Last April , a report from German publication Frankfurter Allgemeine said " Apple is running a secret laboratory for the development of an automobile -- and this in the middle of Berlin . " At the time , the report said the laboratory was reportedly home to 15 - 20 staff with backgrounds in engineering , software , hardware , and sales . LinkedIn suggests that Apple has 168 people working in the " Berlin area . " Many of these employees work in the Apple Store in Kurfurstendam but LinkedIn shows that Apple has dozens of engineers working in Berlin as well . Mapping is one area where Apple seems to be focusing its engineering efforts in Berlin . The company has hired at least half a dozen employees from automotive mapping company Here -- owned by Audi , BMW , and Daimler -- for a Berlin - based Apple Maps team . A source , who wished to remain anonymous , told Business Insider last April that Apple strategically moved in on Here 's talent as the mapping company was passed from Nokia to the German automotive group . " It 's a simple story : Here was in disarray after Microsoft 's acquisition of Nokia , " said the source , who works in the Berlin tech scene . " Apple saw the opportunity and opened an office in Berlin , specifically to siphon Geo Information Systems ( GIS ) talent . " The source said they did not know where the Apple office was when we asked them . A concept Apple Car . Motor TrendApple has never admitted that it is working on an electric car but the company has recruited dozens of automotive experts from companies like Ford and Mercedes - Benz , according to The Financial Times . Apple 's self - driving car efforts are known internally as " Project Titan . " They have been the subject of rumours and speculation for years , and Apple 's focus is now believed to be on building autonomous software rather than an entire vehicle . There may be hundreds of of people working on the project . At one point , former Ford engineer Steve Zadesky , who helped build the iPhone , and Johann Jungwirth , who was Mercedes Benz 's R&D chief , were both working for Apple . Documents obtained by Business Insider earlier this month gave us a first look at this technology , which is " capable of sending electronic commands for steering , accelerating , and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task . " Human drivers remain in the vehicle when the self - driving mode is engaged , and can override it at any time . Apple CEO Tim Cook visited BMW 's German headquarters in 2014 , according to a Reuters report last January , which also stated that senior Apple executives went on a tour of BMW 's Leipzig factory to learn how it manufactures the i3 electric car . Silicon Valley heavyweights like Google and Uber are carrying out their own research into autonomous cars , as are many of the traditional car manufacturers , including BMW , Daimler , and Volkswagen .
