Warren Buffett is the third - richest man in the world , in large part due to his frugality and history of savvy investments . The philanthropist is also known for his caution when it comes to investing in technology . Case in point , he first bought stocks in IBM in 2011 , though the company has been around since 1911 . Buffett invested in Apple just last year . Now , Buffett is putting his weight behind the wearable tech industry , but not because it 's a hot and trendy new area . The Richline Group , a jewelry manufacturer owned by Berkshire Hathaway , is rolling out a customizable line of smart jewelry called Ela ( Elegant Lifestyle Accessories ) . Ela pieces alert wearers when they are receiving a call or text from selected contacts . He explained his reasoning behind the move to CNBC . " Jewelry is a centuries - old business that is n't going anywhere , so it 's a safe bet , " Buffett said . " With the addition of technology , we 're simply updating something everyone knows and loves to better fit our modern age . " It seems that if you want your tech to catch Buffett 's eye , look toward innovating in an industry that 's been around for 100-odd years . Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com .
