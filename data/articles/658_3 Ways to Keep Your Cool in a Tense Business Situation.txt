In the startup world , disputes are going to arise . Whether it 's with employees , cofounders , or potential investors , tense business situations are bound to arise when there 's so much on the line . And while you might be tempted to fly off the handle and give them a piece of your mind , it 's in everyone 's best interest to think carefully about the situation before you dive into conversation . We asked three entrepreneurs what they thought the best way to deal with tense business situations was without losing your cool . Take a look at what they have to say below and keep yourself in check the next time a problem arises : More often than not , when someone gets angry , it 's because they 've taken something personally - how dare they not understand what you 're trying to say , right ? Try to put yourself in the shoes of the person you 're talking to . Consider how they feel about the situation . You might feel like they 're attacking you , but to them , you could well be the one in the wrong . - Steven Buchwald of Buchwald & Associates Whenever I feel a tense business situation , I first look at my own actions and behavior . I can only affect what I do and say , so I remind myself of my values and devise a response accordingly . The relationship or deal may go south , but if I ground my mindset in caring and servicing the other person , I find it is much easier to accept any kind of outcome . - Tony Banter of Picarro It 's easy for written communications like email and text to be misinterpreted . Oftentimes , the situation is n't as bad as we think . Simply picking up the phone and initiating a transparent , authentic conversation can diffuse the tension . - Emily Richett of Richett Media FounderSociety is an invitation - only organization comprised of ambitious startup founders and business owners .
