Get Started > > Entrepreneurs have multiple sources of funding when they seek their first outside capital : friends and family , professional angels , venture capital ( VC ) funds and crowdfunding platforms . One type of funding , which is sometimes overlooked and which can be quite powerful , is corporate venture funds . Corporate venture funds come in different shapes and sizes , but typically , they are funds affiliated with large companies that are interested in tapping into innovation taking place within particular industries . Loosely referred to as " strategic " investors , they represent a fast - growing segment of the funding market . According to CB Insights , there are nearly 200 active corporate VC funds . In 2015 , they invested about $ 18 billion across 850 companies in the United States alone . Notable funders include Google / GV , Comcast Ventures , Bloomberg , Intel Capital and Salesforce Ventures . Given the size and scope of these funds ( and despite some industry misconceptions ) , corporate VCs present a strong option for entrepreneurs looking to get the most value from their investors . So , what are several of the unique advantages that they offer ?   Corporate VC funds can provide access to established customers and accelerate a startup 's ability to find its product / market fit . Most companies creating these funds tend to have large installed customer bases and can identify early adopters for new technology . Gaining this type of entry can be difficult for an unknown startup still trying to build its credibility . The value of nailing down product / market fit can not be understated as it sets the stage for acquiring a company 's first set of paying customers .   Once market validation is achieved , developing a commercial agreement can generate much - needed revenue in the early days of a startup . This should be set up as a stand - alone agreement -- not tied to the investment agreement -- that provides market value to both sides . By securing paying customers , you can lessen the requirements for outside capital and , at the same time , demonstrate a sustainable business model .   Since large companies have a history of being in business , they possess institutional knowledge that can help startups think about issues related to their target market . Daily interactions with customers produce insights that may have implications to a startup 's product or marketing strategy . Furthermore , a startup can improve its visibility in a competitive landscape .   Securing an investment from one strategic investor can encourage others to do the same , because if a strategic partner understands the market and the problem and it 's willing to put money into a company , then there must be value there . Plus , many corporate investors , whether they are investing from the parent company 's balance sheet or a dedicated fund , will invest in multiple rounds . This renewed commitment is a positive market signal and can ease the burden of additional fundraising .   Unsurprisingly , investors often choose to liquidate their positions in a business , particularly if they acquire new companies with pre - existing commercial relationships . Over time , as a relationship develops , dependencies can occur that spur an acquirer to want to own the assets , for offensive or defensive reasons . Diligence for these types of deals is a bit easier as the acquirer is already familiar with the company 's business and executive team , which makes things move along more quickly .   While corporate venture funds are not silver bullets for getting customers or formulating an exit from day one , they can provide a lot of shareholder value if leveraged properly .
