SPARTAN is a French startup which creates radiation - blocking men 's branded underwear . The young Paris - based company just opened an additional office in New York and plans to hit the US market in January . Increasing dependency on wireless technology has led to daily radiation exposure from smartphones , laptops and gadgets . Several research projects came to the conclusion that radiation has a direct and adverse impact on men 's reproductive health . In fact , one recent study argued that men who carry their phone in their pocket or on their belt had lower sperm counts and more immobile sperm than men who did not . The SPARTAN underwear prevents radiation exposure with the incorporation of pure silver fibers that effectively protect man 's most valuable possessions . Additionally , the silver prevents bacteria from proliferating and , in doing so , eliminates odors that may build up throughout the day . SPARTAN CEO and co - founder Arthur Menard stated : " Our mission is to raise the standard of men 's underwear while also putting in mind health and fertility . SPARTAN is the first product that offers this type of protection and it is imperative for such high tech underwear to become the norm . " The French startup hasn't raised any VC funding yet . After a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2016 on Indiegogo , raising almost $ 20,000 in the US alone , SPARTAN began with the production . Launching in January , the boxer briefs will be selling for $ 47 a pair , with bundle packages at reduced pricing .
