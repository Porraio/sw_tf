Buying furniture for a home comes with it 's own sticker shock . Add in a custom - made couch and the price alone could make your heart stop . Well , one founder decided that he was done with the outrageous cost of nice furniture and cut out the middlemen . Rob Royer is the founder and CEO of Interior Define , a startup that builds furniture on demand and will customize everything , including the size , shape , color , fabric , filling , and frame . Rob was one of the early employees at Bonobos and took much of what he learned over to Interior Define , which he launched in 2014 . Through Interior Define , shoppers can buy a hand - crafted , custom - made couch with the fabric they like for a lot less that regular retail showrooms . The challenge Royer had to get over was convincing someone to spend thousands of dollars on a sofa they haven't seen in person . In this episode of Tech in Chicago , we talk about how Royer got involved with Bonobos , how he entered the furniture industry , the importance of partnerships in the lifestyle space , using PR in their early days , building out a guide shop as an online brand , marketing strategy , and how to attract a big hire away from a larger company to work for their startup . We actually recorded this episode sitting on one of their sofas in their Lincoln Park guide shop .   Click here to listen on iTunes or click here to listen on Google Play .
