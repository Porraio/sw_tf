Update : Following publication of the article , the GSMA pointed out its research shows there are closer to 300 tech hubs in Africa . [ infographic ]   Africa is becoming a place for innovation in the startup tech sector , which is in part due to the boost from tech hubs and incubators around the continent . According to research from The World Bank , as of June 2016 there were 173 tech hubs and incubators in Africa , with 32 of those being in South Africa . This is an increase of 56 tech hubs since the September 2015 version of the research . As thorough as the report is , it does miss a few places , such as NGM and the Barclays fintech accelerator . Several hubs have also popped up since then , such French Tech and the University of Johannesburg 's own incubator . There have even been hubs launched outside of the standard tech scene , such as one for food . Read more : Are Africa 's innovation hubs helping innovators realise their full potential ?

The 2015 Ventureburn Startup Survey found that 6% out of just under 200 polled respondents were working out of an incubator or VC office .
