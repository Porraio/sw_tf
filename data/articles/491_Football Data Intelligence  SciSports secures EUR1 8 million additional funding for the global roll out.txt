The Dutch startup SciSports today announced that it has raised an extra EUR1.8 million with existing and new investors . The fresh capital will be used to roll - out the SciSkill Index worldwide and implement the BallJames data machine in various stadiums in countries such as England and Germany . In the last few years , SciSports has worked on building the SciSkill Index , a fully automated solution that calculates the quality , talent , and value of every professional football player in the world . With the in - house developed capturing reality technology called BallJames , which generates complete 3D data in real - time , we created a refined total solution that immediately converts events in practice or during the match to useful information and knowledge . SciSports started in 2012 as a spin - off of the University of Twente and currently has 45 employees . The Enschede - based company has been working for several clubs and agents in the Netherlands , Belgium , England , Portugal , Brazil , Germany , and Italy . The SciSkill Index is probably the only objective worldwide player index that makes it possible to compare the quality of football players all around the world . Every week , over 2000 matches in 210 leagues are analyzed by the SciSkill algorithm , through which the SciSkill Index automatically adjusts the quality of 350.000 football players in an index . The index measures the influence of a player on a match and the individual development . With this , it calculates the market value and the potential of a player , based on his current quality and the growth of other players in the past . The SciSkill is not only interesting for clubs , as it also beats the bookmakers in predicting matches and is the ideal input for Fantasy Football games . BallJames is a real - time tracking technology developed by SciSports that automatically generates 3D data from video images of football matches . In the stadium , fourteen cameras are installed , which record all the movements on the field . BallJames then generates its own data such as the precision , direction and speed of the passing , sprinting strength , jumping strength , player movements and how close the ball stays to the foot after a first touch . The Polman Stadium of Heracles Almelo is the first stadium in the world equipped with this system . At the moment , a second stadium in England is being equipped with the first official Beta version of Balljames and in collaboration with the University of Twente , a test field will be set up for academic research . Giels Brouwer , the founder of SciSports stated : " Football is our focus . With the SciSkill , we have created a new opportunity to help clubs finding talent in undiscovered regions . The unique part is that we have built an index that values a player regardless of his position , club or nationality . Our Datascouting department helps the clubs and explores the market , while the Intelligence department automates their findings through Machine Learning . For this to work , we continuously need better data , which is why we started developing BallJames with which we cover the complete value chain in football . We have noticed that not only the world of sports is open to this new form of information . That is why this year we will invest in automated tooling for the media , gambling and gaming industry . " Gerrit - Jan van Ahee , the CTO of SciSports added : " When BallJames is done , a lot more is possible . Think VR , goal - line technology but for the whole field , think second screen possibilities besides watching football on your TV . It is impossible that we will also deliver the end product in all those markets , but with our engine we will fill the role of pure data supplier . We seek collaboration with existing parties in the market and want to solve the current limitations for them . "
