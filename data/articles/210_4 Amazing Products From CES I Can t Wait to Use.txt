Check back for highlights from the event as well as insights from thought leaders and innovators .   My first day at CES was insane . I saw so much technology at CES , it was mind - numbing . This show is an overload -- in the very best way . It 's a mob ! I do n't know what took me so long . If you 're not at CES , you 're out of it . The booths that were packed and loud were very interactive . They had to be to stand out in this tech - obsessed crowd . The products upstairs -- like 3D printers and smart watches -- were n't exactly revolutionary . These were more or less proven moneymakers . It was corporate . But the atmosphere downstairs was different . It was intense . The startups there are battling it out to eventually make it big and move upstairs , which I ca n't help but love . They 're out there in the aisles , hustling . Fighting tool and nail to get noticed . These are my people . When something was hot , it was obvious , because the cameras were out . Some booths were three or four persons deep the entire day . These were the products that caught my eye the most :   Holograms are here ! And they are amazingly cool , especially Kino - mo . The company creates holographic technology to be used in advertising .   This London - based company 's one - sentence benefit statement : Take your logo to the moon . And they definitely did that at CES . The booth I checked was for Hypervision , Kino - mo 's " holo - displays . " You can think of them like holograms , because that 's what they look like but less costly . That said , so far the holo - displays have been used by brands like Aston Martin , Intel , and Samsung for advertising . Someone on the team had been smart enough to mount the holograms high enough , so that they could easily be seen from a distance , which meant their booth was packed all day long . I must have walked by six times . The visuals themselves were vividly bright and looked as if they were floating . You had to pull your phone out .   I really dug SAM , an innovative new toy from UK - based startup SAM Labs that " allows kids to start building and creating in a really fun and intuitive way , " Morten B. Hagen , head of sales and marketing , told me . Using SAM 's small wireless building blocks and app , children can build and program their own inventions . When Hagen said , " You can think of it like Lego from the future , " within less than 15 seconds , I was sold . That 's a great benefit statement !   Developed by a Julliard - trained musician , I was told anyone can play it . Officially , on their marketing materials , it 's " quick to play and fun to learn . " Interesting ! The company graduated from Y Combinator in winter 2016 and raised $ 415,000 in pre - orders on Indiegogo .   This product was wild . Taking several hundred hours to hand - make in France , it marketed itself as a " combination of the latest technologies with ancient violin - making skills . " Customized and adopted to the user 's body , it was eye - catching and even more fun to watch the gentleman doing the demo wail on it .   I 've been to a lot of trade shows but none that have been so interactive . Much of what I saw downstairs was pre - production and had gone or planned on going the crowdfunding route with Indiegogo and Amazon Launchpad 's presence felt .
