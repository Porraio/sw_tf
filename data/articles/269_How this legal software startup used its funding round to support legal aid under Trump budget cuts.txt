MetaJure founder Marty Smith believes the company 's software can help legal aid providers be more efficient . ( MetaJure Photo )   Many tech companies wait until they grow into big corporations before thinking about corporate social responsibility . But MetaJure , a Seattle startup that provides software to help lawyers manage their documents and email , is starting early . As early as the company 's Series A funding round , in fact . MetaJure is using its $ 2.6 million round as an opportunity for what its founder and director Marty Smith calls " social investing . " For every dollar MetaJure raises , the equivalent value ( in the form of the company 's product ) will go toward legal aid providers around the country . " A ' social investment ' is any investment that seeks to produce a financial return to the investor while also producing a social good . Usually , the social good is produced as the company grows , as might be the case by investing in an alternative energy company wherein over time , carbon dioxide emissions are increasingly reduced . We felt , however , a strong sense of urgency to make an immediate difference so we decided to bring an ' impact investing ' component into play as well , namely where a person 's financial investment causes an immediate social impact . " The program led to the installation of MetaJure 's technology at Georgia Legal Services , Pine Tree Legal Assistance in Maine , Colorado Legal Services , and Legal Aid Society of Orange County . MetaJure also plans to equip Arkansas Legal Services , Utah Legal Services , and the Northwest Justice Project , in Washington , with its product in the next few weeks . In addition to the software , MetaJure provided installation and support training . MetaJure also agreed to continue licensing the software to the legal aid providers as long as they continue using it . MetaJure always planned to give back through philanthropy once the business was fleshed out and profitable but the company 's leadership saw a more immediate need that could n't wait . " Recent political events have compounded the problem by increasing the need for legal advice on hate crimes and immigration , " Smith said . " At the same time , President Trump 's proposed budget eliminates all funding for the Legal Services Corporation , the primary source of financial support for legal aid throughout the country . " When MetaJure 's series A closes , the company will look at other ways to support legal aid providers . One option under consideration is donating the software on a law firm 's or legal department 's behalf in an amount equal to their purchase . The company has raised about $ 7 million to date . Beyond supporting legal aid , MetaJure plans to use the fresh cash to bolster its sales efforts . " MetaJure 's board believes access to justice is a foundational pillar of our democracy , " Smith said . " Not surprisingly , we felt a strong desire to see what we could do to make a difference today . "
