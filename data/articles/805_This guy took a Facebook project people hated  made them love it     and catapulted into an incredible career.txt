Smyte 's Pete Hunt YouTube / Facebook Developers Remember back in 2012 , when Facebook stunned the world by spending $ 1 billion to buy the 13-person startup Instagram ? The purchase seems almost quaint now , when the Valley is overrun with billion - dollar startups , but it blew the minds of Silicon Valley at the time . It was also the turning point in the career for one early Facebook employee , Pete Hunt . Today Hunt is the cofounding CEO of a security startup called Smyte . But he is better known as one of the fathers of a Facebook - born technology for programmers called React . React is one of the most popular open source projects Facebook has ever released and it turned Hunt into a star in the web development world . All thanks to Instagram . And while his startup is n't based on React , its early success is a direct result of how he turned React 's initial haters into fans . Back in the summer of 2012 , Hunt became known inside of Facebook for working on its photo and video features . He and his team had spent the previous year thinking of Instagram as the enemy . Pete Hunt Pete Hunt Then Instagram was suddenly a massive and controversial part of Facebook and Hunt was assigned to bring Instagram into the Facebook fold . " I was the first engineer to go over from Facebook to Instagram . I was the corporate drone , " Smyte tells Business Insider . " They were super nice . But it definitely was like I was the first external person dropped into their tight - knit team . " Hunt was tasked with building Instagram 's first website . The first step was bringing it into Facebook 's " trust and safety " systems -- the tools that protect users from bullies , and fraud , as well as watching for evidence of hate speech or crimes . The second step was to solve a serious technical problem . The company 's database was struggling under the load of all those photos , so to build a website that could grow as Instagram grew , he could n't just add more computer servers . He was going to have to build the app using JavaScript , which makes the PC do most of the work of rendering the photos , not the servers . He started exploring the best ways to do that and came across another Facebook employee , Jordan Walke , who had been working on a " cool " side project to do this , Hunt describes . It was n't a polished tool but he bet Instagram 's website on it anyway . This became React . Hunt was hooked on React and kept adding features and improvements . Word about React grew at Facebook . " More and more products inside Facebook had this same set of problems and wanted to use this technology . This includes mobile search and ad placement , " he says . By 2013 , React had become really popular inside of Facebook and Hunt was known as one of its gurus . The React team decided to share their creation -- free and open source -- with the world at a big Javascript developers conference . " By this time , this technology had been through the ringer . We knew it was awesome and everyone was super excited about announcing it , " he said . But when they showed it off , people hated it . While the team was on stage demonstrating React , the reaction was merciless , Hunt recalls . " Everyone was being super mean on Twitter and Hacker News , " he says . That 's because React involved a new way to organize a web project that involved mixing and matching code written in different formats , something that was always considered to be a major , sloppy no - no . And the team was skewered for it . It was demoralizing . React has become one of the most popular open source tools on the site that stores and shares tools , GitHub GitHub Hunt , who knew how React was helping Facebook , was n't having it . So he created a talk that addressed all of the criticisms and hit the road giving that talk at other Javascript conferences . He also took on the haters directly on Twitter and Hacker News . " I read every comment and replied to every one , " he said . After a while , other people started replying as well , and posting the YouTube link to his talks . React took off . And he became a very popular speaker . " I was flying around the world to different countries every month giving talks . I was flying business class , the conferences were paying for me to come . I felt like a rockstar , " he said . Until one night , when he was at a conference party in Barcelona at 4 a.m. and he looked around at his adoring fans and realized " It was me and a bunch of nerds . And I was like , ' well , I sort of made it . ' " He knew he wanted to do something bigger . The startup bug had bit . He decided his startup would not be based on React but on trust and safety , the first thing Instagram had had to figure out . " There 's a trail of dead companies because they could n't do trust and safety . Yik Yak , Secret , and Twitter is struggling with this too , the abuse problem , " he said . Smyte founders , Julian Tempelsman ( left ) ; Pete Hunt ( middle ) ; Josh Yudaken ( right ) Smyte His success with React and Instagram " was enough for me to have courage to leave Facebook . But I did n't think I was the guy to build it . I needed a cofounder to help me . But even as a so - called celebrity rockstar , I could n't get anyone to quit their job and join me , " he said . He knew the cofounder he wanted , too : Julian Tempelsman . He had met him on the stairs of his apartment wearing a Toga when they all attended a party in his apartment building . It turned out Tempelsman was working on similar security systems at Google and they spent that evening talking about a potential startup . But Tempelsman did n't want to leave Google . After almost a year of pestering , Hunt told him , " I 'll quit my job and we 'll do the fund raise and if it does n't happen , you do n't need to quit your job . If it does , you can still come in as an equal partner " he said . He met his other cofounder , Josh Yudaken , at Instagram . Yudaken was itching to go out on his own , got curious and when Hunt quit Facebook , he jumped in . It did n't take long for Tempelsman to join , too . And it did n't take long to find some seed money . " The seed founder was a friend of a friend of a Google cofounder . I had lunch with him and he wrote a check , " he said . Smyte got accepted into the startup factory known as YCombinator and quickly raised another $ 2.25 million from a number of backers including Instagram VC Steve Anderson at Baseline . It just raised another $ 4 million A round last month . He still contributes to React . And it turns out that his fame in that world , and the way he chased down the haters is helping Smyte win business . " My classic move to get into companies [ for a sales meeting ] is I see question on Stack Overflow , " he says , referring to the website where developers ask each other questions . " I tell them , ' I 'm happy to go in and give your guys a tech talk on React , and since I 'm doing you a favor , can I meet with your team for 20 minutes ? It gets me in the door . " While the startup is n't profitable yet the tactic is working . " We have over tripled our revenue in the past 6 months . We have dozens of customers , and around 100 million monthly active users and monitor tens of thousands of events per second , " Hunt said . Smyte formally launched its product in 2015 and has landed such customers as Indiegogo , GoFundMe , Quora , Medium , Meetup , Task Rabbit and others .
