Get Started > > In Major League Baseball today , teams strive to build winning franchises and billion - dollar businesses that reach far beyond the diamond by capitalizing on a wide spectrum of markets and audiences . Nowhere has that journey been more dramatic than in the wired heart of San Francisco 's high - tech universe , where the San Francisco Giants have excelled on several fronts . Last season , the team hit a major milestone and moved just behind the Boston Red Sox to steal the second - longest sellout streak in Major League Baseball from the Cleveland Indians , selling out 456 consecutive regular - season games at AT&T Park . What 's more widely known are the team 's World Series wins in 2010 , 2012 and 2014 , and while we 're about to kickoff an " odd year " the 2017 squad has back many of the star players that brought them victory in years past . What 's more ,   even in the down years when the team was n't winning the pennant , the Giants sold every seat . Since opening the new ballpark doors in 2000 , the team has welcomed more than 50 million fans . The Giants have done it by appointing executives with a keen sense of product - market fit , such as SVP and CIO Bill Schlough , who became the first CIO ever appointed by a professional sports team when he joined the Giants in April 1999 . I recently had the chance to speak with Schlough , who shared lessons he 's learned over the years . He covered the intricacies involved in fostering a brand that maintains one of the most loyal fan bases in sports today . Many of Schlough 's lessons translate for startup founders building their target audience and customer base in highly competitive markets . The Giants do n't only compete on the field , Schlough said . " We think of ourselves as a member of several markets : baseball , broadcast , entertainment , real estate . But , ultimately , we 're in the happiness business . Our product is bringing joy to our fans . " Of course , different people have very different ideas of what joy is -- and not everyone who goes to a Giants game is there solely for the joy of baseball . As Schlough noted , " If we just focused on baseball fans , we 'd sell 15,000 to 20,000 tickets each game . There 's much more to it than that . " There 's garlic fries , of course . There 's Wi - Fi ( the Giants were the first team to install it ) . There are craft beers and a new " virtual reality experience . " Additionally , there are special events that target specific demographics , such as Jerry Garcia Tribute Night , Cancer Awareness Night and Yoga Day . There is a Star Wars Day and even a Peanut Allergy Friendly Day . In all , there are 33 special days and nights that attract fans that otherwise might not buy a ticket to a baseball game . By targeting specific demographics with added features to the game - viewing experience , the Giants are able to attract additional viewership that would otherwise be absent . Fans these days -- and particularly fans in San Francisco -- demand top - flight technology perks . They want connectivity , multimedia viewing options and even virtual reality . All are vital to selling tickets . But , Schlough warned that it 's not always an advantage to being an early adopter of seemingly cool technology , noting , " You ca n't be an early adopter in everything . " While it 's nice to be first to implement a new technology , it does n't come without pain . It can be extremely valuable to take advantage of your competitors testing out new technologies and then learn from their mistakes . Schlough and his team first focused on tech - centric perks like Wi - Fi , dynamic pricing and seat upgrades . But , even these were challenging to execute at first . Though an eventual success , pervasive and reliable connectivity was difficult . Electric turnstiles for transferable tickets and upgrades also seemed like a great idea , and although it was buggy at first , new scanning technology rendered the original system obsolete . These experiences reminded the Giants that it almost always takes consumer feedback and trial and error before great ideas work well . Ultimately , these are lessons that almost any business should take to heart when thinking about its position in the marketplace . Businesses should also remember that efforts should be focused on their target market first , because even the best product ca n't entice everyone . And when they add new features and products , it needs to be done deliberately , all the while being flexible to insert key consumer feedback back into the product . After all , you ca n't make the market fit your product , but you can always pivot to get the perfect product - market fit .
