If you 're tired of going to unproductive meetings , commuting in to work just to put in face time , or following commands from a boss you do n't have much confidence in , you may be the right kind of employee for a new type of work environment called a DAO , or Decentralized Autonomous Organization . We 're in the early stages of seeing these futuristic types of companies roll out already . These early players have run into some missteps , but that 's to be expected . What 's important in the concept of a DAO is the D : " decentralized . " In a DAO , a blockchain - based organization , you do n't have a boss or a CEO . What you have is a dynamic set of working relationships continuously and dynamically self - organized around outcomes and projects . To participate in a DAO , you must " buy in " , literally . You need to own a " token " or " coin " , the ownership of which is recorded in the blockchain . In the future , obtaining these coins will be easier . Today , the most common route is to buy Bitcoin with your dollars , euros , yen , etc . and then use the Bitcoin to buy the tokens or coins of the specific DAOs in which you wish to be a member . Increasingly , you can buy another crypto - currency , Ether ( based on the Ethereum blockchain ) as your entry point . For many people , Coinbase is the on - ramp of choice to this world from fiat . From there , people go through an exchange like Bittrex or Kraken . Alternatively , someone who has a coin can send you some . For example , if you want some IOP ( Internet of People ) tokens , I can get you some . If you 're willing to do this , you 've already earned it . Welcome aboard . Now , you 're in . * ( IOP is just one of many DAOs vying to make an impact . Full disclosure : I own some IOPs ) . Now that you are a " member " of the DAO , which is provable to all via the public , open ledger that is a blockchain , your compensation comes in two ways : The increase in the DAO 's token value comes simply from supply and demand . As the total token supply for each DAO is either fixed or predictably inflationary and it is known to all , the value of the tokens increase along with demand . ( A key benefit is that the supply of tokens is not easily subject to future dilution by central administrators such as government officials or incompetent executives . Ah , the power of blockchains ! ) . While you can buy more tokens or simply sit back and watch / hope that the value of your tokens increases , you can also earn more of them by helping the DAO achieve its objectives . To understand how that works , there are a few things you need to understand about DAOs vs. traditional organizations . Unlike a traditional organization , the priorities of a DAO are n't " set from the top . " There 's no command and control . There 's no boss . While there may be active members of the community who have identified certain needs , say " a new website " or " a new feature for an application , " it 's not a mandate . No one must do it . But if a project makes the DAO more valuable , useful , or meaningful for its members and for potential future members , then ( and here 's the beauty of it ) people WANT to do it . It 's in their own best interest to do so . Because the one thing that everyone in the DAO shares is this : Every single person wants the value of the tokens to increase . So , everyone is hyper - focused on putting as much value into the DAO as possible and , conversely , extremely disinterested in doing anything that does n't add value . And this is where the opportunities abound for people like you . If you identify an opportunity to add value to the DAO -- " Hey , the website is too slow and I can make it more responsive " ( for example ) -- you can submit a Contribution Contract ( here 's how you can do it for IOP and for DASH ) to the community and make the proposal . You lay out what you are going to do for the DAO and how you think it will add value . The other existing token holders have an opportunity to vote on your proposal . If your proposal is persuasive in that others believe it is really going to increase the value of the token , then it will pass . If it is n't , then it will fail . We can dive into the different forms of DAO governance another time , but for now , let 's assume this voting system works well enough . And let 's assume your proposal passes . You commit to a set of deliverables over a period and , in return , you are " paid " by the DAO in new tokens at a predefined interval . You may earn 10 tokens every hour or 10 tokens every month . You set the price , others approve it or reject it . Once you have made a deal with the DAO , it 's in the blockchain . You 're good to go . Your job now is " deliver or have your contract canceled . " If you do n't deliver , you lose credibility within the community and get perceived as someone who does n't add value . You probably wo n't have too many opportunities to earn tokens in the future because people wo n't vote you in . Reputation matters ... a lot . This makes you hyper - focused on managing your time and efforts . Which is where the freedom from bad meeting tyranny comes in . At this point in your DAO relationship you are asking yourself , every moment of every day : " Will this add activity value to the project ? " If yes , you do it . If no , then you say , " You know , my skills and time are better spent elsewhere . " And since there are no bosses , you do n't catch any heat . Sure , there are politics , as is the case with any organization with more than one person , but it 's of a different nature . In a " traditional " command and control environment , authority determines effort . That 's why your boss can make you go to a bad meeting . In a decentralized environment , value contributed to the project 's success determines influence . That influence determines where efforts should be focused . Bottom line : Your incentive is to create as much value as you can for the project , based on your skill set and beliefs , not based on what your boss thinks . We 've heard the words " radical transformation " or " radical disruption " so many times that it has risen to " boy who cried wolf " levels . I get that . It sounds almost implausible . But , if you believe ( as I clearly do ! ) that blockchain and decentralized technologies represent a once - in - a - generation type change that , like the Internet , will touch every aspect of our lives , then it is n't such a far cry to think that the entire way we work will change too . As Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos famously said , " When I 'm 80 , am I going to regret leaving Wall Street ? No . Will I regret missing a chance to be there at the beginning of the Internet ? Yes . " Make sure you do n't miss the beginning of the DAO era . * Standard legal disclaimer here . This is n't an official " giveaway " or promotion . I 'm just trying to help .
