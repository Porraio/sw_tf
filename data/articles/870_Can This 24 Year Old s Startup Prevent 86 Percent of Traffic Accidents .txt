Over 35,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2015 ( the last full year available ) , and more than 30,000 fatalities occur annually . Prevention is is an area where businesses are active -- with some working to create autonomous vehicles that eliminate human error altogether , and other , perhaps more practical , startups , striving to assist business owners , teens and other drivers to curb their driving mistakes , some of them fatal . Certainly , autonomous cars are nice , in theory , but a number of logistical and legal hurdles are preventing them from becoming a practical reality . Nor is their widespread adoption likely any time soon . But , what if a new app and technology could prevent up to 86 percent of traffic accidents altogether ? Innovative Technology for Transportation ( ITFT ) is a North Carolina - based company , currently in its crowdfunding stage , which has designed a Safe Driving System , ( SDS ) whose up - and - coming app and technology is designed to prevent speeding and reckless driving . The U.S. Department of Transportation has calculated that 94 percent of all traffic accidents are attributable to human error , so the Safe Driving System is designed to reduce those errors through controls and notifications that limit driver behavior . Compatible with any car manufactured since 1996 , the Safe Driving System will be targeted primarily toward teenagers ( and their reasonably worried parents ) . When the SDS is installed , parents will receive alerts whenever their teens drive over a designated speed threshold and when they make it to their destinations safely ( or , less happily , when an accident has occurred ) . The technology , however , also applies to businesses : It will be available to employers to keep track of their company vehicles and employee - drivers . Plus , individuals can use the SDS to gain a better awareness of their personal driving habits and to block distracting apps on their mobile devices ( while they retain access to necessary phone and navigation functions ) . ITFT is further working on a " panic button , " designed for integration with ride - sharing services like Uber and Lyft . If pressed , the panic button will simultaneously alert local authorities and force the vehicle to come to a stop , while recording video and audio of the scene . Then , the door will automatically unlock , allowing the passenger to exit safely . The button will be available for both drivers and passengers . ITFT is n't the first company developing technology designed to help drivers and prevent traffic accidents , but it is one of the only solutions capable of issuing both speed and reckless driving alerts . Zubie , for example , was designed as a GPS tracker for teenage drivers , but ca n't alert parents when their teenagers are going over the speed limit . Instead , its technology is designed to send alerts when the car goes over a manually set speed . Hum , by Verizon , works similarly . Almost every solution now on the market will come with a monthly or yearly fee , usually in the neighborhood of $ 10 per month .   The founder of ITFT , Matthew Godley , has said he was inspired to create the system after experiencing the deaths of community members in traffic accidents . Still relatively young , Godley , now 24 , has assembled a team of engineers , innovators and advisors to help make his vision a reality . Currently , ITFT is listed on Start Engine , a crowdfunding website designed to help entrepreneurs meet their fundraising goals with the help of the general public . Until the offering deadline of April 2 , 2017 , investors can purchase up to 100,000 series B non - voting common shares of the company at a price of $ 10 per share .   Chances are , the SDS is just the beginning of a new wave of technology aimed to help control traffic accidents in this country . Some companies are targeting the improvement of vehicles , with higher safety standards , automated elements , and in some cases , full autonomy . However , the other side of the equation is the driver : Until autonomous cars become reality , controlling driver behavior is the best tool available for limiting traffic accidents .
