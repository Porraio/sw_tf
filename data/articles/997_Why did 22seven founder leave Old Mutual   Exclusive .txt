News broke earlier this week that 22seven would finally be absorbed into Old Mutual , following the app 's acquisition in 2013 . It was also confirmed that co - founders Christo Davel and Kenny Inngs would be leaving the business as a result . Now , Davel has explained the reason for his departure in an interview with Ventureburn . " It was just a differing of long - term strategies , mostly ... " Davel explained in a telephonic interview , confirming that it was a mutual agreement . " Oh yes , it was a very amicable agreement between us and Old Mutual . " Davel confirmed that 22seven was looking for buyers last year , elaborating on the process . " We were engaged with a couple of potential buyers , but none of the ... deals came to fruition between the buyers and Old Mutual ... And subsequently ... Old Mutual decided to not sell their stake in 22seven . And that 's when me and my team decided that the best thing for us will be to step out and carry on with our strategy elsewhere . " At the time of the deal in 2013 , the two companies said that expansion plans were afoot . In fact , Old Mutual 's Carlton Hood said that the UK was the first target for expansion . So what became of those plans , then ? " We still have that ambition . We still think our future strategy ( is to ) expand outside South Africa . And Old Mutual does n't , " Davel answered . Does that mean that we could see a 22seven rival ? " We have a very clear and fair arrangement with Old Mutual . We wo n't compete exactly with 22seven as it is today . We definitely are ... formulating some plans which we think will be exciting and will address the needs of the consumer . There are just so many opportunities out there at the moment with how technology is evolving . " Ventureburn focuses on startup news and technology trends in emerging markets .
