startup pitches . Company : GoLocalApps . Headquarters : Sacramento , California . Founding Team : The awesome team of GoLocalApps , with CEO , Heidi Komlofske , techy , Ross Rojek and programmer , Casey . Why we like it . Designing an app could not be easier ... or could it ? Apparently - according to GoLocalApp - yes , yes it could be . Much easier , in fact .   If you 're not a guy in glasses , in a simple t - shirt and with an over - the - shoulder computer bag - yep , your stereotypical tech wiz - then getting onto AppToolKit , from GoLocalApp , would give you plenty of time to get to your Friday night drinks and Sunday family day .   AppToolKit , is a program that lets app developers track and share their app reviews , create smart websites for their apps , and create screenshots for app stores . It 's been created for the non tech guys , both in marketing and developing who want to manage their apps quickly and easily from the one place . Fun fact -there 's more than two million apps on the market and more than a million app developers . Not so fun after all . Realistically , this makes your competition pretty strong . But you should n't let that deter you . If you have a brilliant , app - worthy idea that will save the world ( or maybe just your local community ) it should be on the market .   Now you might be thinking , since there 's so many app developers out there , surely there 's a better app you can download to help your cause , right ? Wrong . Although there are many apps that allow users to monitor reviews or create screenshots for app stores or app landing pages , no one product does all of it in one place .   Who does n't judge a book by its cover ? If the book cover is your incentive to open the book , the screenshot is your doorway into the app . When you 're giving an app 30 seconds of your time , then you 're going to be judgemental at first glance . With AppToolKit 's Screenshot Builder you can draw your users in with an inviting capture of what you 're all about . And you 're not just limited to portrait scaped views , horizontal screenshots can be added as well . Apparently at the moment , AppToolKit is the only app that lets you do this .
