University of California , Berkeley , ranked No . 1 in a list of the top universities that send graduates on to careers in Silicon Valley . Keegan Houser and Facebook / UCBerkeley An elite university located on the outskirts of Silicon Valley has proven itself as a pipeline for tech talent . Silicon Valley hires more alumni from University of California , Berkeley , than any other school , according to a new analysis from online recruiting company HiringSolved . Berkeley beat out Stanford University ( No . 2 ) , Carnegie Mellon ( No . 3 ) , and the University of Texas at Austin ( No . 5 ) in becoming the university that sends the most graduates on to careers at Silicon Valley 's top 25 tech companies by revenue . Of the top 10 universities , none were Ivy League schools . The survey , which was reported on by The San Francisco Business Times , used data from more than 10,000 public profiles for tech workers hired or promoted to new positions in 2016 and the first two months of 2017 . Shon Burton , CEO of HiringSolved , said in a statement that tech industry recruiters are looking for a " strong fundamental understanding of the basics of technology , " above Ivy League credentials , in their new hires . " Often what separates say , a good engineer from a great one , is a knack for understanding the baseline ' how 's ' and ' why 's ' of how things work - the physics of the technology , " Burton said . Berkeley sits about an hour 's drive north of the area where major tech companies like Google , Apple , Facebook , and Tesla have headquarters . The university 's proximity to Silicon Valley has long attracted aspiring tech workers who hope to intern there or find capital to launch startups . Its career fairs are well attended by top recruiters . An aerial photo shows the University of California , Berkeley , campus .

A new program at Berkeley wants to launch future tech leaders by teaching the variety of skills required of them in the real world . The Management , Entrepreneurship , & Technology ( MET ) Program will provide students with dual degrees in business and engineering in four years , in the hopes of giving graduates a command of leadership and technology skills and putting them on an accelerated path to CEO . The program has already caught the attention of a top investment firm . Kleiner Perkins announced it will give an interview to every incoming MET student for its fellowship , which lets students join its portfolio companies in design and engineering roles for the summer . " It looks like it is going to be the most elite tech leader factory there is , " Michael Grimes , managing director at Morgan Stanley and a founding advisory board member of MET , told Business Insider in April . Over 2,500 high school seniors applied for the 30 spots in MET , making it more selective than Harvard , MIT , and Stanford , with an acceptance rate of less than 2% .
