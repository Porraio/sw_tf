Apply now to be an Entrepreneur 360(tm ) company . Let us tell the world your success story .         Get Started > > Ten years ago , Steve Jobs stood on stage and changed the world . He took all information ever created and put it in our pockets , along with a mobile telephone and a music player . And it blew our minds . The launch of the iPhone was a defining moment in our history not for what is was , but for what it became and the advances that it led to . Technical developments have come thick and fast in the last decade , and the exponential advances have not only led to a huge boost on Wall Street but also spilled over every industry from security to health , entertainment to architecture , ecommerce to transportation , and created real change in billions of people 's lives . With so many different industries being transformed by technological advances , it 's hard to know which is going to create the biggest change . Experts from a plethora of industries are predicting the trend to watch to be across hundreds of verticals , including AR / VR , cloud migration , nanotechnology , blockchain , AI and mass personalization , but these all miss the biggest trend that is guaranteed to touch upon companies , governments , institutions and individuals alike .   The ideological shift to incorporate continuous transformation will be the defining hurdle for every business or individual trying to stay relevant . This may sound abstract , but in reality , is simple : Organizations spend huge amounts of money every year to stay on top of current trends . They get Facebook pages , and Twitter accounts ( or even Snapchat ) , optimize their SEO to adapt to Google 's new algorithms and ensure their systems are running on the newest technology ( usually upgrading only once every few years ) . These adoptions or transformations come at a cost , with the need for new training , deployed slowly through the organization to ensure proper uptake and adoption . The issue facing organizations today is that the speed in which these advances are being released is increasing , and the need for their adoption likewise must be faster , else they run the risk of being outpaced by the competition . Continuous transformation requires a shift of focus away from the improvements gained from the adoption of new technologies or processes to concentrating on bettering the adoption process from what is usually a slow , costly and cumbersome process , to a streamlined natural integration . Becoming agile in this way will allow companies to evolve faster , more effectively and cheaper than they are doing currently -- a lifeline in the current ecosystem of breakneck speed innovations . Being able to adapt at speed will be the deciding factor in the success or failure of every company , regardless of size or industry . Right now , there is a high school kid working on something in her garage that has the potential to destroy Facebook , college students are in their dorm rooms busy coding a program that could flip everything we know about AI on its head , and startups around the world are creating new innovations that massive enterprises will need to adopt to stay on top of their game . Without a mindset of continuous transformation at the very core of a business , it becomes fragile no matter how large or established it is . I 'd love to know your prediction for the biggest trend for 2017 , and how the mindset of continuous transformation manifests in your companies .
