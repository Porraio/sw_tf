" The 4th Industrial Revolution , characterised by digitisation and automation , is gaining momentum . It will fundamentally change the way is which we live , work , transact and trade . " It thus stands to reason that the small business and co - operatives sector must future - proof their core business offerings and business models , in order to be part of a digitised world and economy , failing which they will fall behind and remain trapped in a survivalist mode , " said Zulu .
