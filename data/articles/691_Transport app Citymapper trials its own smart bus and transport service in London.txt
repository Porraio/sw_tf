Popular city transport app Citymapper has revealed an ambitious plan to reinvent the humble bus , creating vehicles fit for the smart city era . Citymapper , if you did n't know , is a mobile app that rose to prominence in London for its user - friendly interface that combines multiple transport options to help users find their way from A to B based on their preferred criteria . For example , the app may give the quickest option using a combination of train , tram , and bus ; or , if you 've already invested in a rail card , it will give you train - only options ; or it will also suggest a " rain safe " option that minimizes the amount of time walking between transport options during a torrential downpour . Since its inception in 2011 , Citymapper has rolled out to dozens of conurbations globally , including New York , Boston , San Francisco , and Tokyo , and it has raised around $ 50 million in venture capital funding . The London - based startup has been at the center of much speculation over its future direction and how it plans to grow -- for many , it is a prime acquisition candidate , with companies such as Google surely keen to snap up the design team and data upon which Citymapper has grown . But few will have predicted that the hitherto software - only company would be toying with launching a physical bus and associated service . But that , it seems , is what it is doing . Kicking off in London this week , Citymapper is launching an experimental " popup " circular bus route ( for free ) with its own green , branded buses . Above : Citymapper buses . Similar to traditional buses , the Citymapper vehicles follow pre - set routes , with passengers able to jump on and off at bus stops . And for now , the vehicles have been given some technological overhauls . For example , there will be a large screen that shows riders where they are in real time , and what 's coming up on the route -- similar to how its smartphone app works . And they also have USB charging ports . Above : Screen on the bus . If you 're already familiar with transport apps such as Citymapper and Google Maps , you 'll be aware of certain features that tell you which part of a vehicle is the busiest at a certain time of day -- for example , it may recommend that you enter the last coach on a train given that it should be the least busy . But such features are n't based on real - time information ; they 're estimates based on historical data . With its own bus , Citymapper has access to the very fabric of the vehicle , and it has installed its own tracking software that integrates directly with the app . It also boasts real - time passenger counting so it ( and you ) can know how busy a bus is . Looking to the future , it 's easy to see how useful this could be if rolled out at scale . Imagine if every bus , boat , and train in London was kitted out with sensors and counters , with the data made available to third - party service providers -- this could help cities manage transport infrastructure far more effectively . Other than that , however , the first version of these buses are fairly standard , with a driver ( yup , no autonomous aspirations yet ) , bells , and seats . But it 's worth noting here that this is the very beginnings of what Citymapper is calling a push to create " better mobility and cities , " according to a blog post on the initiative . " We 're reinventing the entire software stack for running and operating a bus . " We 're already seeing interesting collaborations between ride - sharing services and city authorities to help improve congestion and planning efforts . Uber has partnered with cities such as Boston to offer trip - level data such as pickup / drop - off locations , distance traveled , and duration , which helps establish traffic patterns and may inform decisions around improving roads or creating parking zones . GPS data is also being collected from a number of other e - taxi platforms to improve road conditions in developing countries , while in China Didi Chuxing 's data is being meshed with smart traffic light systems to ease road congestion . Citymapper 's ambitions seem to fit nicely with these other efforts around the world , though with a focus firmly on improving public transport , it is bringing its own unique flavor to the mix . " We built software for everything , including real - time operational control to driver management to scheduling systems , " the company said . " We 're reinventing how to think about all of these in the real - time world . We 've taken systems that haven't traditionally talked to each other and integrated them . " The company hasn't elaborated on what 's coming next with Project Grasshopper , but ultimately this is all about catering to the emerging smart city revolution . Buses typically follow set routes , but these routes may not serve people best if the majority of passengers typically have to walk 15 minutes once they disembark . And this is the challenge Citymapper is looking to solve with its new buses : How can it improve routes , or identify new ones that are sorely needed ? " In the era of smartphones we can have responsive buses that react to real - time needs , " it said . " Buses also get a bad rep , and are seen as a sub par experience . Even when they 're the best transport option , some people do n't take them . Perhaps we can help change that by improving the bus experience . " This is one program we 'll be keeping tabs on for sure .
