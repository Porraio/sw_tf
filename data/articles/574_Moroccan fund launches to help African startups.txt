Morocco - based seed fund Outlierz , has launched and aims to provide smart capital to African startups . The organisation looks at startups with an MVP or an executable prototype , who are in the pre - seed or seed stages . They should also have a ticket size between US$ 50 000 to US$ 200 000 . Startups also looking to raise seed or Series A round funding are also eligible . Outlierz will also provide startups training tools , such as advice and access to its network . " We started from a simple yet striking conclusion : too many startups fail at the pre - seed and seed stages because of a lack of appropriate resources . We intend to change that by providing smart capital to the continent 's most promising companies , " says founder and managing director of Outlierz , Kenza Lahlou , in a press release to Ventureburn . " The target outcome will be a stronger pool of high potential startups that are ready for subsequent investment and , in the end , lead to success stories that are uniquely African . " The fund is backed by Angel and VCs , such as the CEO of YCombinator , Michael Seibel , 500startups MENA partner , Hassan Haider , and tech entrepreneurs from Africa and Morocco . Those looking to apply can do so through the Outlierz website .
