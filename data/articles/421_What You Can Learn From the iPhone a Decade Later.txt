Get Started > > Ten years ago , the late Steve Jobs -- bespectacled and black - turtlenecked , as per usual -- took to the stage at the 2007 Macworld convention in San Francisco . He began his presentation with the amount of modesty you would expect , which is to say , not much . " Every once in awhile , a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything , " he said . Jobs couched the imminent announcement as one years in the making , the latest in a long line of industry game changers from Apple -- putting it in a family tree with 1984 's Macintosh and 2001 's iPod . Playing up the drama , he said that the company had made three new products : a widescreen iPod with touch controls , " a revolutionary mobile phone " and " a breakthrough internet communications device .   He repeated himself a few more times as the audience started to get it , finally ramping up to the big finish . " These are not three separate devices . This is one device , " he said as the cheers started reaching rock concert decibel levels . " And we are calling it ... iPhone . Today , Apple is going to reinvent the phone . " In 2006 , the cool kids had phones such as the Motorola RAZR or LG Chocolate . The mobile device of choice for tabloid page regulars such as Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton ( were we ever so young ? ) was a Blackberry . Nokia , Sony , Samsung and the Palm Treo ( remember the stylus ? ) got some play too . But in 2007 , nothing on the market looked quite like the sleek new iPhone . And customers would have to wait from the beginning of January until the end of June , and only if they had AT&T , to get their hands on it .   Apple being Apple , the launch was not without controversy . Shortly after the announcement , Cisco sued the company for trademark infringement over the use of the iPhone name . And while the 8 GB model initially retailed for $ 599 , the price dropped to $ 399 a few months later , which irritated many early adopters , so much so that Jobs personally wrote a letter of acknowledgment and apology . But as that first year drew to a close , the company had sold more than 1.4 million phones . This year saw the release of the iPhone 7 -- though one of the more memorable things to come out of that announcement might have been the company 's " courageous " removal of the device 's headphone jack . Probably the biggest smartphone news this year other than Samsung 's Note 7 debacle was the launch of Google 's first smartphone , the Pixel . But even if some of the iPhone 's more recent changes have been on the small side , there is no denying that you know an Apple product when you see one . I spent an afternoon this holiday weekend in an Apple store surrounded by friendly salespeople in red shirts -- for Christmas instead of the customary blue -- with white Apple logos . I found myself waiting for the better part of an hour and a half for my 16 GB iPhone 5 , with its rapidly depleting battery , to be backed up to the iCloud so I could load all my information onto my shiny iPhone 7 , with its Apple Pay , water resistance and biometric log - in .   Now , what I learned from this experience is that I need to regularly backup my devices . But for entrepreneurs who are inspired by Apple 's decade of smartphone dominance , the lessons here are to build consistently evolving products which can act as a showcase for your company 's entire array of work , and to develop a design aesthetic that is uniquely your own .
