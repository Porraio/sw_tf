New Economy Accelerator ( NEA ) has selected 12 entrepreneurs to join its 10-month readiness programme , which commences in February . The objective of the NEA is to find SMEs in SA which could potentially have a large impact socially and environmentally , as well as to provide those startups with the necessary support and development assistance needed to scale successfully . Those selected attended a three - day NEA bootcamp to determine whether or not they make the cut for the programme . The participants were selected for their use of innovative methods to tackle challenges such as nutrition , sustainable agriculture , digital inclusion , renewable energy as well as waste management among others . The following startups were selected to participate in the NEA : " The aim of the NEA is to identify committed social entrepreneurs with innovative businesses that have high potential to transform rural economies in South Africa and the continent , " said the convener of the NEA , Dr Mao Amis , in a press release to Ventureburn . " Rural economies are critical for driving social transformation , yet face significant challenges resulting in high levels of youth unemployment and food insecurity . The NEA aims to promote inclusive business models that will help create opportunities in rural economies to rejuvenate the sector . " Amis also commented on the importance of having more gender diversity in the programme . " Women make a third of the intake and the majority are youth under the age of 35 years . We are delighted about that , because women continue to be under - represented in entrepreneurial development programmes and in many sectors of the economy . "
