startup pitches . Company : Arrivedo . Headquarters : San Francisco and Lima . Founding Team : Alonso Franco and Rodrigo Lopez . Why we like it : Because it 's organised ! Simple . That 's all you want . Travelling should be one of your most liberating experiences , not a time waster , worrying about where you should be . But let 's keep it real , arriving fresh to a new place can be a little daunting and things always tend to go wrong .   Disculpa , excuse me , where can you recommend me to find the best ceviche in town , accompanied by a live band , relaxed environment and a good glass of wine ? A patient and friendly receptionist should know exactly in what directly you should go , as they would have answered similar questions many times before . It 's always the same answer . But this can be organised and coordinated so much quicker . By linking you to the app Arrivedo , all your hotel 's local recommendations are set out right in front of you . Hotels can create articles about recommendations , by inserting places , tips and photos on a map to share insights to their guests . This application can also be found online and is a comfortable link between the customer and their hotel . It works both ways . Locals know where to go and travellers are looking for their tips .   Arrivedo helps a hotel stand out by being that ideal guide - info ready and keen to help the traveller get the most out of their time in their city . Of course , the travel hardened may not need this level of hands on care - after all , they 're old hands at this . Still , for those stepping out of their bubble , the app could be a good bet . Whether you have a day , a week or a month you can get to all the most recommended places that suit your style .
