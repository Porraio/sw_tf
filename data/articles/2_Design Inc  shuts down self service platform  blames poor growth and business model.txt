Five months after pivoting away from its 99designs - like service to become a more relationship - based marketplace , Design Inc. announced that it 's reluctantly shutting down its self - service platform . The company cited less - than - expected traction and a flawed business model . While the service is no more , Design Inc. said the company is " not going anywhere just yet " and will be taking time to " figure out the answer " to what 's next . " We are still dedicated to bringing excellent product design and design thinking to the world , but we want to take a moment and reevaluate how we approach our offering , " the company wrote on its website , explaining the news . Launched in 2016 by Marc Hemeon and Bjoern Zinssmeister , Design Inc. wanted to be the " operating system for designers , " a valuable resource for creative professionals looking for jobs and building relationships . Initially , the idea was that companies would list out what they wanted and then designers would create it . The company later pivoted to its current incarnation , in which companies submit a Request for Proposal ( RFP ) and are matched with designers . In a Medium post , Hemeon said that " hundreds of companies " have benefited from the service but that " not everything has been working as planned . " He declined to cite specifics about what did and did n't work . At one point , Hemeon told VentureBeat that the company counted brands like Nike , Google , Twitter , GoPro , Adidas , Evernote , Netflix , Uber , and Salesforce as customers . Designers with an account on Design Inc. will receive refunds for outstanding credits over the next week . All data from accounts and profiles will be removed . Design Inc previously raised $ 2.3 million in venture funding backed by Harrison Metal , David Tisch 's BoxGroup , Collaborative Fund , O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures , Okapi Venture Capital , and 500 Startups .
