( Appuri Photo )   It 's been a busy start to 2017 for Appuri . The Seattle - based startup just landed $ 2 million in funding from existing investors Divergent Ventures , Vulcan Capital , Baseline and TDF Ventures to help companies keep customers invested in their services . Appuri will use the cash infusion to expand its sales , marketing , product and success teams . Apprui , which launched in 2012 and graduated from the 9Mile Labs accelerator in 2013 , collects customer usage data to predict when customers are dissatisfied with a service so companies can combat attrition . Appuri 's platform applies a " churn score " to various customers , indicating the likelihood that they may leave .

Owens replaces Damon Danieli , who co - founded Appuri with Bilal Aslam , a former Microsoft employee who previously ran the Windows Azure Store .
