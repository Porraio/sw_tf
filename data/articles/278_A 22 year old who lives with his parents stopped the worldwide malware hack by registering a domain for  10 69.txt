PA The " accidental hero " who halted the global spread of an unprecedented ransomware attack by registering a garbled domain name hidden in the malware has warned the attack could be rebooted . The ransomware used in Friday 's attack wreaked havoc on organizations including FedEx and Telefonica , as well as the UK 's National Health Service ( NHS ) , where operations were cancelled , X - rays , test results and patient records became unavailable and phones did not work . But the spread of the attack was brought to a sudden halt when one UK cybersecurity researcher tweeting as @malwaretechblog , with the help of Darien Huss from security firm Proofpoint , found and inadvertently activated a " kill switch " in the malicious software . The researcher , who identified himself only as MalwareTech , is a 22-year - old from south - west England who works for Kryptos logic , an LA - based threat intelligence company . " I was out having lunch with a friend and got back about 3 p.m. and saw an influx of news articles about the NHS and various UK organisations being hit , " he told the Guardian . " I had a bit of a look into that and then I found a sample of the malware behind it , and saw that it was connecting out to a specific domain , which was not registered . So I picked it up not knowing what it did at the time . " The kill switch was hard coded into the malware in case the creator wanted to stop it spreading . This involved a very long nonsensical domain name that the malware makes a request to - just as if it was looking up any website - and if the request comes back and shows that the domain is live , the kill switch takes effect and the malware stops spreading . The domain cost $ 10.69 and was immediately registering thousands of connections every second . MalwareTech explained that he bought the domain because his company tracks botnets , and by registering these domains they can get an insight into how the botnet is spreading . " The intent was to just monitor the spread and see if we could do anything about it later on . But we actually stopped the spread just by registering the domain , " he said . But the following hours were an " emotional rollercoaster " . " Initially someone had reported the wrong way round that we had caused the infection by registering the domain , so I had a mini freakout until I realised it was actually the other way around and we had stopped it , " he said . MalwareTech said he preferred to stay anonymous " because it just does n't make sense to give out my personal information , obviously we 're working against bad guys and they 're not going to be happy about this . " He also said he planned to hold onto the URL , and he and colleagues were collecting the IPs and sending them off to law enforcement agencies so they can notify the infected victims , not all of whom are aware that they have been affected . He warned people to patch their systems , adding : " This is not over . The attackers will realize how we stopped it , they 'll change the code and then they 'll start again . Enable windows update , update and then reboot . " He said he got his first job out of school without any real qualifications , having skipped university to start up a tech blog and write software . " It 's always been a hobby to me , I 'm self - taught . I ended up getting a job out of my first botnet tracker , which the company I now work for saw and contacted me about , asking if I wanted a job . I 've been working there a year and two months now . " But the dark knight of the dark web still lives at home with his parents , which he joked was " so stereotypical " . His mum , he said , was aware of what had happened and was excited , but his dad had n't been home yet . " I 'm sure my mother will inform him , " he said . " It 's not going to be a lifestyle change , it 's just a five - minutes of fame sort of thing . It is quite crazy , I 've not been able to check into my Twitter feed all day because it 's just been going too fast to read . Every time I refresh it it 's another 99 notifications .

REUTERS / Kacper Pempel / Illustration / File Photo Proofpoint 's Ryan Kalember said the British researcher gets " the accidental hero award of the day " . " They did n't realise how much it probably slowed down the spread of this ransomware " . The time that @malwaretechblog registered the domain was too late to help Europe and Asia , where many organisations were affected . But it gave people in the US more time to develop immunity to the attack by patching their systems before they were infected , said Kalember . The kill switch wo n't help anyone whose computer is already infected with the ransomware , and it 's possible that there are other variants of the malware with different kill switches that will continue to spread . The malware was made available online on 14 April through a dump by a group called Shadow Brokers , which claimed last year to have stolen a cache of " cyber weapons " from the National Security Agency ( NSA ) . Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user 's data , then demands payment in exchange for unlocking the data . This attack used a piece of malicious software called " WanaCrypt0r 2.0 " or WannaCry , that exploits a vulnerability in Windows . Microsoft released a patch ( a software update that fixes the problem ) for the flaw in March , but computers that have not installed the security update remain vulnerable . I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after i registered it , so initially it was accidental . -- MalwareTech ( @MalwareTechBlog ) May 13 , 2017 I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after i registered it , so initially it was accidental . The ransomware demands users pay $ 300 worth of cryptocurrency Bitcoin to retrieve their files , though it warns that the " payment will be raised " after a certain amount of time . Translations of the ransom message in 28 languages are included . The malware spreads through email . " This was eminently predictable in lots of ways , " said Kalember . " As soon as the Shadow Brokers dump came out everyone [ in the security industry ] realised that a lot of people would n't be able to install a patch , especially if they used an operating system like Windows XP [ which many NHS computers still use ] , for which there is no patch . " Security researchers with Kaspersky Lab have recorded more than 45,000 attacks in 74 countries , including the UK , Russia , Ukraine , India , China , Italy , and Egypt . In Spain , major companies including telecommunications firm Telefonica were infected . By Friday evening , the ransomware had spread to the United States and South America , though Europe and Russia remained the hardest hit , according to security researchers Malware Hunter Team . The Russian interior ministry says about 1,000 computers have been affected .
