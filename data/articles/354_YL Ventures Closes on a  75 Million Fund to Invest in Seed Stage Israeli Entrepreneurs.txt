SAN FRANCISCO & TEL AVIV , Israel-(BUSINESS WIRE)-May 4 , 2017-   YL        Ventures , the premier seed stage venture capital firm headquartered        in Silicon Valley while investing in Israel , today announced it has        closed its third fund , YLV III . The new fund builds on the success of        its two prior funds , both of which generated returns in the top quartile        of all North American Venture Capital funds , according to Preqin .            YLV III was significantly over - subscribed with nearly 100 percent of        existing YLV II investors participating , and closed on $ 75 million , 25        percent above its target of $ 60 million . The fund will invest in seed        stage Israeli companies in high - growth sectors including cybersecurity ,        enterprise software , autonomous vehicles , drone technologies and VR / AR . 1         YLV III aims to invest in two to three companies per year . Initial seed        investments will be $ 2 - 3 million , with YL Ventures leading the rounds . A        large portion of the fund is reserved to participate in U.S. VC - led        follow - on rounds of its portfolio companies .            Heading the new fund is Silicon Valley - based Managing Partner Yoav        Andrew Leitersdorf , a serial entrepreneur and early stage investor for        25 years who founded the firm in 2007 . Rounding out the team is Ofer        Schreiber , partner , leading the Israeli office ; Iren Reznikov , senior        analyst , and Sharon Seemann , marketing director . YL Ventures is        currently recruiting additional investment professionals to join its        Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv offices .            Leitersdorf attributes the heightened interest in YLV III to soaring        cybersecurity spending , expected to exceed $ 202 billion in 2021 ,        according to Markets&Markets , and the deep domain expertise and        experience in cybersecurity that Israeli entrepreneurs possess , most of        who graduated from the IDF 's intelligence units .            " For YL Ventures , this convergence represents an opportunity to address        evolving security risks and leverage Israel 's unique talent pool to meet        mounting global demand for the most effective solutions , " said        Leitersdorf .            " Israel is a well - known powerhouse for cybersecurity and related        technological innovation . We are able to harness that expertise to        expand into new sectors that leverage artificial intelligence , machine        learning , computer vision , big data and robotics , all of which are        highly relevant to our new fund . While remaining extremely selective , we        can vet ideas fast , devote substantial attention to helping our        companies scale , and provide a lot of value post - investment . "            YL Ventures is also expanding its leadership team with the addition of a        number of high - caliber and experienced venture advisors . Justin Somaini ,        chief security officer at SAP , is the first of these . A prominent        security industry angel investor , board member and advisor to many        security startups , Somaini said he is eager to deepen his relationship        with YL Ventures and assist early - stage cybersecurity startups coming        out of Israel to scale their businesses globally .            " I 've been collaborating with YL Ventures for some years now and know        they have unparalleled access to Israeli cybersecurity talent and        innovation , " he said . " I 'm looking forward with great anticipation to        working more closely with the entrepreneurs the fund selects to help        them bring the next wave of technological innovation to market . "            Based in both Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv , the firm has early        and deep access to the Israeli entrepreneurial ecosystem as well as        an active presence and strong network in the U.S.            " Out of the hundreds of startup ideas we evaluate every year , we only        invest in the select few we believe are the most brilliant . This enables        us to truly partner with the founders , actively support each company and        give it the full attention it deserves , " said Schreiber . " We then        leverage our Silicon Valley presence to create business opportunities        and guide founders through the challenges of penetrating global markets        and building great companies . It 's a model that is not easily reproduced        and creates a true win / win for entrepreneurs and investors . "            This model has yielded a track record of successful exits . The combined        funds , YLV I and II , have invested in 10 companies , five of which have        already been successfully acquired . Most recently , FireLayers ( cloud        access security broker ) was acquired by Proofpoint , and BlazeMeter        ( performance testing platform for DevOps ) was acquired by CA .            Among the current YL Ventures portfolio companies : Twistlock ,        ( virtual container security ) , which last week announced        a $ 17 million Series B funding round ; Karamba        Security ( Autonomous Security for autonomous and connected cars ) ;        and Hexadite        ( security orchestration and automation ) .            Yair Grindlinger , FireLayers co - founder and now vice president of        Information Protection Products at Proofpoint , said , " YL Ventures was        not just an investor , they were an integral part of our team and        essential to our successful exit . YLV 's entire model is built around        helping entrepreneurs . They commit time and resources and continue to        back the companies over the long - term .
