Just ask anyone , anywhere , ever , and they 'll tell you : Buying and selling homes is a risky business . But help 's supposedly on the way , in the form of yet another attempt at disrupting a business ostensibly in desperate need of a paradigm shift .   At least , if you ask the people behind the startup . That 's what the people at Nested , a London - based endeavor , are thinking . Nested guarantees it 'll sell your house within 90 days ( at 95 to 98 percent of market value ) , or offer you a cash advance against the sale . Now , it 's raised EUR8 million euro ( $ 8.6 million USD ) to do so , bringing its total funding to EUR11 million , TechCrunch reported .

What 's in it for Nested ? If they score a higher sale price than what 's agreed upon , it 'll take 30 percent of the difference , and give the rest to the property owner .   Again , it 's a lot of risk , and Nested is far from the only player . Opendoor , a startup with a similar mission ( but based in San Francisco ) raised $ 210 million in a Series D round in November . That brings its total funding up to $ 320 million .   But Nested and its founders remain confident . They 've helped five sellers a month so far . Their next goals , according to TechCrunch , are to hit 100 deals per month , and not too long after that , 1,000 per month .
