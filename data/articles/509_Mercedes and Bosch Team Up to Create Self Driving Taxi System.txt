Joining a field already filled with the likes of Lyft and Uber , Mercedes wants to help populate streets with its own robo - taxis . Mercedes 's parent company Daimler has partnered with automotive supplier Bosch to create its own system of self - driving vehicles , which the companies hope hit the streets by 2020 . Mercedes and Bosch are going above and beyond : Rather than simply creating a fleet of autonomous cars , the alliance seeks to create a shared network of self - driving robo - taxis that can be hailed through a smartphone app . The companies ' new project plans to include both autonomous vehicles that require a human driver behind the wheel and ones that do not . The system and its fleet will be specifically designed for cities . With Daimler 's expertise in auto manufacturing and Bosch 's technology and hardware , the companies are in a good position to make a dent in the market . Daimler 's Mercedes - Benz has already been working on developing its own self - driving cars . And the German automaker has already gotten a taste of the car - sharing business with its company car2go and its mobility service subsidiary Moovel Group , which owns route planning startup RideScout and taxi booking app Mytaxi .
