Crowdstrike founder CEO George Kurtz Crowdstrike Crowdstrike , the security startup best known for discovering that Russians were behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee , has raised yet another $ 100 million . The six - year - old company has now raised $ 256 million and is valued at just under $ 1 billion , the New York Times reports . This $ 100 million was led by Accel . Crowdstrike had also raised $ 100 million back in 2015 led by CapitalG ( formerly Google Capital ) that valued the company at $ 667 million . The investment in Crowdstrike comes at an interesting time . Security breaches are continuously making headlines and one of Crowdstrike 's biggest competitors , Tanium , was the subject of much bad press last month . Tanium raised $ 287 million of venture investment at a valuation of $ 3.7 billion , making it one of the most highly valued security startups in tech these days . But its CEO was accused of firing employees right before their stock vested ( a charge he denied ) and the company was then accused of inappropriately exposing a hospital 's network by doing live demos ( a situation the company sort of admitted to ) . Missteps by one competitor is an opportunity for another . And VCs are flush with cash right now , looking to pour more money into strong companies , although perhaps not at the super sweet terms they were offering back in 2015 . Crowdstrike has not been without its controversies , too . In February , the company tried , and failed , to get a temporary restraining order and injunction to stop a software testing lab , known as NSS Labs , from publishing results of a test that pitted CrowdStrike 's software against several competitors . The company says it 's growing quickly , and that 's the thing that 's music to a VC 's ears . Although CrowdStrike has not released revenue numbers , it says it counts 10% of the Fortune 1000 as customers and has seen big growth in the number of deals valued at $ 1 million or more per year .
