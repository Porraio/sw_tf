Canadian game accelerator and investor Execution Labs is shutting down . Jason Della Rocca , cofounder of the Montreal - based company , announced on Facebook that the company has deployed all of its capital and that it will not be making new investments . " Well , that 's been an intense and inspiring four and a half years ! , " Della Rocca wrote . " Execution Labs was a crazy idea from the start , and we had no clue if doing early stage investing and providing hands - on support would enable entrepreneurial game developers to flourish . We now have 20 or so active game studios in the XL family , and they are all working on amazing stuff . So , we 're pretty sure the answer is ' yes . ' " The company started in 2012 . " The awesome XL support team will be moving on to new adventures of their own . My co - founder Keith Katz and I will too , though we will still help our portfolio studios at a strategic ( and sometimes tactical ) level , " Della Rocca said . " At a time when the game business has been evolving constantly , I have learned as much as I 've mentored . I am thankful to all the teams for the amazing experiences we have shared together , " Della Rocca , and he thank all those who helped the company . Della Rocca gave a talk at the recent Casual Connect Europe event in Berlin . He did a tongue - in - cheek session about why game startups wo n't get funding , but he stirred a lot of criticism for his perhaps overly harsh views .
