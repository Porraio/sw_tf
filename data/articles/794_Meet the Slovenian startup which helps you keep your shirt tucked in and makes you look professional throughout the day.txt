Ok , this one is not exactly a tech startup , but still an interesting young company with an innovative product . The Slovenian company NV came up with an new solution for men to keep their shirt tucked in throughout the day . Think about how often you have to tuck your shirt back in during a long day in the office or on the road . With the new NV S - Holder , this problem now gets solved . The brand name is a bit tricky , since it 's pronounced almost like ass - holder . But still : It 's an interesting product ! The S - Holder basically works like upside down suspenders . They clip to your shirt to keep it weighed down . Such S - Holder sets are available for $ 38 and can be shipped worldwide . To be fair , NV might not be the inventor of this concept , but with their design and crowdfunding approach they make this type of solution accessible to a young audience of men .   NV currently does a 2nd crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter . They already raised $ 70,700 and the campaign will run for another month . The first campaign also was successful and was set up to create the previous version of the product , called T - Holder .
