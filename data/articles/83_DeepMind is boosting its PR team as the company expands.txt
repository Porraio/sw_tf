Ruth Barnett is also a former Sky News reporter . YouTube / RuthBarnettGoogle DeepMind has expanded its public relations and communications team as data regulators prepare to pass decisions that have the potential to damage the company 's image . In the last two weeks , Google 's artificial intelligence ( AI ) lab has hired ex - Snapchat PR Ruth Barnett and former BBC News tech editor Jon Fildes , meaning that DeepMind now has around five full - time media relations staff . London - based DeepMind relied on Google 's army of PR employees up until last October when it started building out its own team . The unit is headed up by Ollie Rickman , who worked in comms at Google for several years before leaving to cofound Milltown Partners , where he advised US tech companies , European startups , and venture capitalists . The latest PR appointments at DeepMind , which is developing algorithms that can learn and think for themselves , come as the company faces increasing scrutiny from regulators and the media . Of particular note is a controversial data - sharing deal that gave DeepMind access to 1.6 million NHS medical records without patients being informed . This week , it emerged that Dame Fiona Caldicott , the National Data Guardian and the most senior data protection adviser to the NHS , concluded that the deal was legally inappropriate . The Information Commissioner 's Office , the UK 's main data watchdog , is carrying out its own investigation into whether the deal was legal under the Data Protection Act and a verdict is expected to be made public in the coming weeks . However , Business Insider understands that Barnett and Fildes were not hired to work on the DeepMind Health side of the business . DeepMind enjoyed a lot of positive publicity after it developed an algorithm that successfully defeated the world champion of Chinese board game Go -- an incredibly difficult game for machines to master due to the sheer number of potential moves . The research company , which has published over 100 papers and is widely regarded as a British success story , has also made headlines for helping Google to save vast amounts of energy in its power - hungry data centres . DeepMind currently employs around 400 staff in King 's Cross and a small team in Mountain View but The Economist reported last Decenber that the company could soon be expanded to around 1,000 people .
