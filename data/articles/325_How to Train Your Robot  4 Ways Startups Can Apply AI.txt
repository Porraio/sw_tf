Register Now > > Despite nationwide venture funding hitting a multiyear low , venture capital deployed to artificial intelligence startups has reached a record high . Last year , VCs struck 658 deals with AI companies , nearly five times the number that signed on the dotted line four years before . To date , the market contains 2,045 AI startups and more than 17,000 market followers , with more joining by the day . AI 's rapid rise has swept up startups and enterprises alike , including U.S. automaker Ford , which recently bought AI startup Argo for $ 1 billion . The acquisition cements experts ' suspicions of Ford 's coming foray into self - driving technology . Other startups -- so many , in fact , that entrepreneurs need a " best of " guide -- are betting heavily on bot platforms . So while we 've just glimpsed the tip of this innovation iceberg , it 's clear AI is no longer some nebulous technology of the future . Sixty - eight percent of marketing executives , according to media research firm Weber Shandwick , report using AI in their operations . For a technology that only went mainstream in 2016 and barely existed four years ago , that 's a remarkable adoption rate . How , regardless of the platform you choose , can you join forward - thinking entrepreneurs and build your business with AI ? So far , four ways stand out : A politician would n't dream of delivering a small - town stump speech to her urban constituents . Why ? Because you 've got to know your audience . The same is true for entrepreneurs . Before you broadcast your message , you need to know who you 're trying to reach . Node , an account - based intelligence startup , uses natural language processing -- a fancy term for teaching a computer to understand how we humans speak and write -- to develop customer profiles . Node is crunching vast swaths of data to connect the dots between marketers and the companies they 're trying to reach . Once you have ample customer data -- Node uses data crawlers to scrape information from social media , news sites and more -- pair machine learning and natural language processing models to extract sentiments from unstructured data . Then , just as senators segment constituents into demographic groups , Node uses cluster analysis to sort clients ' customers into like cohorts . If , heaven forbid , you forgot to tag your neighbor at last week 's house party , Facebook was no doubt there to remind you of your error . How does Facebook know which of your friends you left untagged ? It has gone all - in on an AI technique called convolutional neural networks . Convolutional neural networks , which loosely model how the brain 's visual cortex interacts with the eyes , work by separating an image into tiny portions before running each of those specks through a multilayered filter . It then " sees " where each speck overlaps with other parts of the image , and through automated iterations , it puts together a full image . Many different ways exist to apply this technology , but retail businesses can start with image classification . Try using a convolutional neural network to break down photos of your products posted online . The model can identify customer segments that frequently use your product , where they 're using it and whether they commonly pair other products with yours . Essentially , this automated image analysis can show you how your products fit into customers ' lives , allowing you to tailor your marketing materials to fit . Success on social media requires careful listening and quick action . When a social campaign is n't working , it 's best to put it out of its misery quickly . On the other hand , when one strikes a chord with customers , doubling down pays dividends . But to do so , you need real - time insights about customers ' reactions to your content . Fortunately , AI can take the emotional temperature of thousands of customers at once . Dumbstruck , a video - testing and analytics startup that I advise , has added natural language processing to its emotional analytics stack . This allows it to provide moment - by - moment insights into viewers ' reactions to media . Dumbstruck 's model grows stronger with each reaction analyzed , producing a program that perceives human emotions even better than some people can . Customer service is -- or should be , according to consumers -- the department that never sleeps . More than half of people , 50.6 percent to be precise , believe a business should be available 24/7 to answer their every question and concern . When asked whether businesses should be available via a messaging app , the " yes " votes jump to nearly two in three . Fortunately , bots do n't sleep , eat or go off - script . A well - built bot can offer cost - effective , constant customer service . Of course , grooming your bot to serve customers requires front - end data -- ideally hundreds of thousands of example conversations -- but you can get started with a human - chatbot hybrid . With this approach , the bot answers run - of - the - mill questions , while a human takes over for the more complex ones . Then , as the data builds and the model matures , you can phase in full automation . Taco Bell , for example , knows taco cravings come at all times of night . Its TacoBot takes customer orders via Slack chat . Ticketmaster , a popular concert ticket provider , also offers an automated chat widget that informs users about new events and provides order details . Artificial intelligence is not just the stuff of Netflix shows and sci - fi paperbacks . Today , it 's as real as the customers it serves , the marketers it informs and the companies it scales . The intelligence may be artificial , but the results are absolutely not .
