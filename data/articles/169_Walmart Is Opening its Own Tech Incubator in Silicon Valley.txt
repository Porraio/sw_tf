Like Target and Amazon , Walmart is trying to figure out what the future of retail looks like . The company already bought startups such as Jet.com and clothing store ModCloth to better compete online , but Walmart 's next move will invest some of its sizable coffers directly in the next generation of retail technology startups through its own tech incubator . According to Jet.com founder Marc Lore -- now CEO of Walmart 's ecommerce division -- the group will be called " Store No . 8 " and will focus on investing in companies that cover all the buzzwords from virtual and augmented reality , to machine learning , robotics and artificial intelligence . As Bloomberg reports , the new tech incubator was named after a shop in Arkansas where Sam Walton used to experiment with store layouts and will be based in ( where else ) Silicon Valley . While Lore did n't reveal how much Walmart would be investing in the project , Store No . 8 will be headed up by Walmart SVP of Digital Store operations Seth Beal and VP of Incubation Katie Finnegan , who also came from Jet.com . While the companies at Store No . 8 will operate independently of Walmart corporate and its research company @WalmartLabs in San Francisco , the end goal here is to create new tech that will help Walmart 's bottom line -- whether that be through new online boutiques like ModCloth or new ways to skip the checkout lines in the store . Plus , when your competition is riding robots and planning a delivery service for the moon , the only smart move is to respond by opening a tech incubator .
