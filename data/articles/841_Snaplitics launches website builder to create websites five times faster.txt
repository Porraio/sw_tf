Austin - based startup Snaplitics , Inc. today launched the Snaplitics Website Builder . The Snaplitics digital toolkit offers an affordable tool for creating professional websites and landing pages without having to hire developers . " A professional website that looks less than 3 years old and tells a story is a crucial component of a business 's success , " said co - founder Sean Hynes . " We wanted to make the process widely approachable to even non - tech - savvy users without inflated , never - ending developer fees . "   Hynes and co - founder Mykola Bashlakov said it was their mission to provide a website builder that is five times faster and provides a reliably advanced alternative to prohibitively limited mainstream website creation tools . Snaplitics was launched based on the idea that the future of website construction is with easy - to - use website builders . As a web developer , Hynes experienced this firsthand when he was losing business to WordPress and their peer website builders . However , Hynes ' personal experiments with these builders proved to be incredibly limiting . He did not like being boxed in by static templates , unintuitive user interfaces , tedious hand coding , security holes , and loss of data ownership in services like Google Analytics .   Hynes explained why he wanted to build Snaplitics , " I wanted to help business owners , employees , bloggers , and casual web users with all levels of technical experience to modernize their dinosaur websites and help them launch a successful business on the web . " Users can build their website with an intuitive row and column level drag - and - drop interface that is not restricted to a template . Innovative features like SnapStats analytics provide detailed , real - time data about customers , heat maps and more . Additionally , Snaplitics is equipped with powerful marketing software that includes lead capture pop - ups , integrated landing pages , and social media sharing .
