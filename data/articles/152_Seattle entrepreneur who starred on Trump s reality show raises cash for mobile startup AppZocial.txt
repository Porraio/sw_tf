AppZocial co - founders James Sun and Ben Liu . ( AppZocial Photos )   AppZocial , a Seattle startup that builds native apps for " trusted communities , " like alumni groups , churches , and non - profits , just secured $ 1 million in angel financing . The majority of the cash will support a new partnership with Blackbaud , a South Carolina - based company that makes software for the kinds of groups AppZocial already caters to . Under the agreement , AppZocial will build native apps for Blackbaud customers and data from those apps will be integrated into the Blackbaud CRM . " Blackbaud 's a pure integration and distribution space for us , " said AppZocial CEO James Sun . " They 're the gorilla of that industry and so if they say that this is a good solution , what tends to happen is all these organizations listen to them . " Sun is a University of Washington grad and serial entrepreneur . Before AppZocial , he founded restaurant deals startup Pirq and led it through an acquisition by iPayment in 2014 . But Sun is probably best - known as a finalist on President Trump 's former reality show " The Apprentice . " While he was running Pirq , Sun invested in a seed round for Anomo , a dating app founded by Ben Liu . It proved to be a promising business relationship ; the two went on to co - found AppZocial together . AppZocial employs 11 out of its downtown Seattle headquarters . The startup will still continue building custom apps for clients outside the Blackbaud network . Sun declined to name the angel investor backing the new company . " Overall it 's the trend that mobile apps have been very , very prevalent for consumers and so the consumer expectation of their experience is extremely high because they 're used to Snapchat , Facebook , Twitter , " said Sun . " A lot of these traditional organizations , like higher ed , non - profits , associations , they do n't have the budget , nor do they have the experience , to deliver consumer - expected experiences that are at the high level that 's out there today . That 's one of the things that 's driving our business . "
