New York Fashion Week kicks off tomorrow , but ahead of the couture designs hitting the runways , an unlikely company is stepping into the fashion world . Google partnered with Ivyrevel , a women 's clothing brand based in Stockholm backed by H&M and Paypal , to make customized dresses using an individual 's data footprint . The Data Dress is designed around information collected from your phone via an Android app developed with Ivyrevel and powered by Google 's Awareness API . " The technology is able to learn from your activities . It understands what you love to do and where you love to go , " Ivyrevel co - founder Kenza Zouiten explains in a video about the concept . As you go about your day , the app collects information such as your location , physical activity and the weather . An algorithm then processes that data to generate a unique and personalized garment that you can buy through the app , which will be available later this year . The dresses come in at at least $ 99 , according to the Ivyrevel site . Check out the video below for more . Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com .
