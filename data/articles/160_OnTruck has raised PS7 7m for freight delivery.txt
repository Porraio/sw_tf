The OnTruck team OnTruck Spanish startup OnTruck has raised $ 10 million ( PS7.7 million ) in a Series A round led by Atomico and Idinvest for a freight delivery platform . OnTruck is an on - demand platform that pairs businesses with freight carriers to ship their goods . The idea is to undercut intermediaries which , according to Atomico partner Carolina Brochado , charge a hefty commission fee . She said : " Road freight remains a massive market that is still largely undisrupted by technology , representing around 10% of European GDP . " Today , intermediaries charge 15% commission to manually match supply and demand , relying heavily on email , phone calls and even fax . " The company will hire more engineers and product staff and expand into Europe beyond Madrid and Barcelona . OnTruck was founded in 2016 by former PwC consultant Inigo Juantegui and shipping veteran Antonio Lu Lee . Existing backers Point Nine Capital , La Famiglia , and Samaipata Ventures also participated in the funding round .
