Pet ID tag company PetHub and tracking technology startup Pebblebee have settled a contract dispute over a deal to develop pet tracking tags and a companion smartphone app , according to court records . A Jan. 13 court filing in King County Superior Court , signed by lawyers for both companies , says that " all claims against all parties in this action have been resolved , " and all hearings in the case have been cancelled . Financial terms of the settlement were not disclosed in the court record . Both companies are based in Bellevue , Wash. " It 's a relief to have the case behind us so that we can focus on the year ahead , " said PetHub CEO Tom Arnold in response to GeekWire 's inquiry . " I wish Pebblebee only the best . " Pebblebee CEO Daniel Daoura declined to comment . According to PetHub 's complaint , the dispute dated back to July 2014 , when PetHub announced the PetHub Signal electronic ID tag after signing a deal with Pebblebee to develop the tags . PetHub alleged that Pebblebee did n't live up to the terms of their agreement , and marketed a competing product in violation of their deal . In previous court filings , Pebblebee denied the allegations and filed its own breach of contract claim against PetHub . PetHub alleged that the tracking tag 's battery drained after two weeks , rather than the promised one year . The suit also claimed that the software on the tag did n't work properly , and the promised smartphone application was n't developed according to the requirements of the contract . In a court filing , Pebblebee acknowledged that " it advised PetHub that the batteries for the first order of pilot tracking tags depleted too quickly , " but said that Pebblebee " promptly corrected this issue within two months and before PetHub ordered any more tags . " In addition , Pebblebee denied in court filings that its own " Honey " device competed with the product that was jointly developed by the two companies .
