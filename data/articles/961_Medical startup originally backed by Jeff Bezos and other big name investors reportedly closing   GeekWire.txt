Erika Bliss , co - founder and CEO of Qliance . ( Qliance Photo )   Qliance Medical Management Inc. -- a Seattle - based primary care provider originally backed by the likes of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos -- is shutting down , according to sources cited by The Puget Sound Business Journal . The last day of operation for the company 's primary care clinics will be Friday , June 1 , according to an employee who spoke to the newspaper anonymously . Qliance CEO Erika Bliss told the PSBJ the company will officially close its doors June 15 , two weeks after the clinics shut down . Qliance has not responded to GeekWire 's requests for comment . Qliance was originally a well - funded startup , with a total of $ 33 million raised in 2013 . The company 's backers included Bezos , venture capitalist Nick Hanauer , Zillow Chairman Rich Barton , comedian and Seattle Sounders owner Drew Carey , Dell founder Michael Dell and others . Last March , the company was bought out by Bliss and president Cheryl Kilodavis . Bliss told GeekWire in an interview three weeks ago that she and Kilodavis wanted to keep the company under their own control , and said they were looking for alternative funding sources to investments . She said they had difficulty finding sources of funding outside the traditional venture capital world . In an internal memo from Bliss obtained by the PSBJ , she said the company was unable to find the funding to last them until they were able to find new contracts . A small team from Qliance will help transition patient needs to other providers over the next month , the memo said . It also said the company will be helping patients with essential services including urgent care and prescription needs .
