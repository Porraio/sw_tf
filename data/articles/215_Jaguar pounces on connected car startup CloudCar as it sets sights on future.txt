British automobile giant Jaguar Land Rover has announced a closer relationship with CloudCar , a startup specializing in connected car experiences , by making a $ 15 m investment .   CloudCar , which is based in Palo Alto , California , is a world - leading developer of connected driver experiences . With machine - learning capabilities tied to various sensors in the car , its CloudCar 's cloud services platform allows car manufacturers to use its capability -- including improved voice - activated applications and personalisation -- while still maintaining their brand identity and retaining ownership of data . Hanno Kirner , executive director of corporate strategy for Jaguar Land Rover , said , " This represents an important step in developing connected car technology . CloudCar has been working with premium manufacturers on some of the most exciting opportunities and challenges in the fields of machine learning and infotainment . " This investment is integral to Jaguar Land Rover 's vehicle technology programme : but the programme also presents an invaluable opportunity for other automotive manufacturers to get involved . " The eventual need to integrate into the car hundreds of driver - focused global cloud services and content means this platform is an excellent example where cooperation between OEMs can improve outcomes for customers , as well as reducing costs . " According to reports from VentureBeat , CloudCar raised $ 11.5 m while in stealth mode back in 2012 , so this latest cash injection takes the company 's total outside investment past the $ 25 m mark . For Jaguar Land Rover , the investment is part of the company 's ambition to be the first to roll out the next - generation CloudCar platform in its first fully electric model , Jaguar I - PACE . Philipp Popov , CEO of CloudCar , said , " We are excited to deepen our relationship with Jaguar Land Rover and we also look forward to other manufacturers benefitting from our recent progress . "
