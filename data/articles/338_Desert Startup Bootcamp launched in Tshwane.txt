Youth - run educational organisation Speak Afrika , along with the Charities Aid Foundation Southern Africa ( CASA ) and the US Embassy in Pretoria , have launched the Desert Startup Bootcamp in Tshwane this week . The Desert Startup Bootcamp was co - founded by Mandela Washington Fellows Mhlanganisi Madlongolwana and Sam Beckbessinger . " This is particularly close to my heart as I come from these communities where access to markets and mentors is a big challenge for startups , " said Madlongolwana in a statement . The bootcamp will select 55 aspiring entrepreneurs from 180 applicants from Tshwane and will put them through a three - month " experiential learning programme " . The entrepreneurs will meet for weekly workshops , mentoring , engagement sessions and pitching sessions to hone their products and presentation skills . All these activities will take place at the American Corner in Pretoria . The hub provides the participants with high - speed internet , equipment as well as digital resources to aid them during their time in the bootcamp . This will all be done in preparation for a pitching competition held in August which will be the foundation for the Desert Startup Bootcamp participants to build a larger client base , networks and to land possible investments . " Together we 'll create a vibrant culture of youth entrepreneurship that is ' plugged - in ' to a national and international ecosystem of entrepreneurs , experts , industry leaders and mentors , whilst still recognising the local challenges that young entrepreneurs face in our market , " said Beckbessinger , the other co - founder of the bootcamp .
