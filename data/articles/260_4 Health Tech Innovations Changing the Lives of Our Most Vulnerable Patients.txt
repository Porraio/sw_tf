Health innovations that are helping people care for our most vulnerable communities are something to celebrate . Advancements in healthcare technologies have revolutionized the well - being of children , the mentally handicapped , neonatal patients and our elderly . So , here 's to your health , and cheers to four healthcare innovations that are reshaping human longevity and quality of life for future generations . Using light to treat depression ( or painfully pale skin ) is a long - standing form of treatment . But for Dr. JoQueta Handy , light therapy has brightened the worlds of many living with Down Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorder . The World Health Organization has officially identified ASD as a " global health priority . " In response to those concerns , specialists like Dr. Handy have dedicated their lives to unlocking learning barriers by developing revolutionary approaches to teaching children with these and other learning disabilities . With methods such as Quantum Reflex Integration and Interactive Metronome usage , Dr. Handy has perfected a holistic education discipline called the " Children 's Opportunity for Brilliance " model . She uses this platform to inform fellow educators about the best ways to teach special needs children . " It 's not the only solution for learning strategies , " Handy said , " But it 's a solution for bringing doctors , parents , and teachers together so that hopefully we can create the hub for the wheel of the child . " For Tammy Bowers , the development of Lionheart Innovations was a labor of love based on necessity . Tammy needed a resource that could condense the contents of her massive binder into one application that could track her son 's medical information . She believed technology was the solution to control the complexities of medical caregiving for her son , and that platform has been a literal lifesaver for thousands of people who need a way to better manage chronic health problems . " The Lionheart app does n't simply track and store medical information , it empowers patients and their providers through data , " Bowers said . This application offers medication management , scheduling , and many other features that can better inform providers of necessary data . For Owlet Baby Care CEO Kurt Workman , designing a hospital - caliber baby monitor for home use was a challenge that has paid off for thousands of new parents . The Smart Sock uses pulse oximetry , which is used in most hospitals . The sock is worn by infants and monitors the baby 's heart rate and oxygen levels . Should these levels drop , the device will trigger the base station that collects these vitals via Bluetooth . Parents can know immediately if there is a problem . " Owlet collects more data in one night than a doctor collects in one year , " Workman said . This new technology has caught the attention of many organizations including Entrepreneur Magazine , which honored them as one of the top 100 Brilliant Companies of 2016 , and Forbes Magazine , who included them on their Next Billion - Dollar Startup List 2016 . With statistics showing 46 percent of health - care referrals never result in a scheduled appointment , and over half ( 55 percent ) of specialist visits are deemed unnecessary , ReferralMD believes there is a better way to consolidate health information accessible by healthcare settings , particularly post - acute care organizations . For example , ReferralMD believes that by including post - acute care in these new interoperability strategies , " healthcare organizations can ensure critical patient information across all care settings will be connected , providing a more detailed patient picture for more specific treatment plans and improved patient care . " As the scope of healthcare demographics shifts , ReferralMD is ready to change how healthcare companies communicate by creating a seamless , efficient , life - saving strategy that will benefit tomorrow 's patients and streamline the process for healthcare providers . As we witness today 's advances in light therapy , collaborative healthcare applications , wearable tracking devices , and interoperability among healthcare organizations , we have much to be thankful for when it comes to our health . For those unique populations in need of special care , good health remains our best investment . Ayodeji Onibalusi is an inbound marketing expert and advocate of high quality digital marketing .
