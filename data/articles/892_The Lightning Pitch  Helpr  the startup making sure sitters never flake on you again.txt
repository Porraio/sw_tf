startup pitches . Company : Helpr . Headquarters : Los Angeles , California . Founding team : Co - Founders Kasey Edwards ( CEO ) and Becka Klauber Richter ( President ) . Why we like it : Being a parent is hard . Getting freedom from your kids is even harder . Helpr is the get out of jail -- or rather , escape your children -- card that everyone has been looking for . Helpr identifies as a real life babysitters ' club , providing parents and carers with reliable , pre - checked babysitters ( i.e. , ones safe to work with kids ) . Serving the on - demand economy , as it were , the Helpr app offers hundreds of screened and trusted babysitters who are available with as little as three hours notice . According to the team , unlike other babysitting services , Helpr 's babysitters have in - person interviews with Helpr staff and are background checked , double referenced checked , and CPR certified . The app currently services Los Angeles , Orange County , and Santa Barbara , with plans to expand to additional areas in the near future . Co - founding team Edwards and Richter are both UCSB grads and are also founding members of FFLA ( Female Founders Los Angeles ) , a group of women supporting women in tech leadership . According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics , day care and childcare as an industry will see some of the biggest growth in the run up to 2020 , putting Helpr on track to have serious disruptive potential . So , potential bugs ? Well , mainly , that people like to stick with who they know . Uber is great , but has it replaced ' the guy ' we have in our contacts book ? Probably not . Similarly , we like to stick with the same doctors and teachers etc etc , so babysitters could be suspect to our own innate clinginess . But then , lets not forget -- they help you escape your kids . Oh , the humanity .
