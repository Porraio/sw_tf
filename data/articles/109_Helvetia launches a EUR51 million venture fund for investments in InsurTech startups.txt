Helvetia Insurance is launching its own venture fund for investments in startups at the beginning of 2017 to help drive forward digitisation . The newly established Digital Ventures department will be responsible for the new fund . The Swiss insurance giant plans to systematically invests in startups which are contributing to the digital transformation of Helvetia 's existing core business , thus facilitating targeted business model innovations . Around CHF 55 million ( more than EUR51 million ) will be invested in approximately 25 young companies over the next few years . Helvetia will set up a fund management company in Luxembourg for this purpose . The new fund will focus on insuretech startups . These are young companies active in the traditional value chain of an insurer . On the other hand , it will invest in startups whose business models link to Helvetia 's business in any way possible . Helvetia aims for operational cooperation with all startups . The investments are therefore made primarily in countries in which Helvetia operates , i.e. Switzerland , Germany , France , Italy , Austria and Spain . Philipp Gmur , the Group CEO of Helvetia , stated : " The Helvetia Venture Fund will make a substantial contribution to the successful implementation of the helvetia 20.20 strategy . In order to make use of business model innovations , we want to invest in the appropriate start - ups and work together with them . " In the venture capital sector Helvetia is working together with St . Gallen - based b - to - v Partners AG . The Helvetia Venture Fund will thus benefit from the startup deal flow and the experience of b - to - v . However , the investment decisions will be taken by Helvetia . This allows for the necessary agility , lean processes and short decision - making routes for all investments .
