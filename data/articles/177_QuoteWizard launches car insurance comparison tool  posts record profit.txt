After a rocky end to 2016 , Seattle - based insurance comparison startup QuoteWizard is back in the game . The privately held company today announced the launch of a new car insurance tool , CarrierCompare , and told GeekWire that March of 2017 was its most profitable month yet . QuoteWizard was growing quickly last year , approaching $ 100 million in revenue and opening a new office in Denver . But in November , it announced 50 layoffs , about 30 percent of its workforce at the time . QuoteWizard CEO Scott Peyree told GeekWire the layoffs were due to constrained spending by the insurance industry , where the company makes its money , and that the company was looking for more sustainable business solutions . Now QuoteWizard says it is projecting revenues of $ 75 million to $ 80 million for the year , and it posted a net profit of over $ 1 million in March . It 's also hiring again for some positions . Peyree said the turnaround was both because of an upturn in insurance spending and because the company has started to see payoffs from tech and strategy investments . The 100-person company is now in the running for the Bootstrapper of the Year award at this year 's GeekWire Awards , taking place May 4th at Seattle 's MoPOP . " The psychological impact of running a company where it is not only your own blood and sweat , but also all of your ( and your partners ) own money provides a focus and desire to succeed that you do n't get when taking outside investment , " Peyree told GeekWire earlier this week . The new CarrierCompare tool allows users to directly compare car insurance plans from 30 insurance providers , giving objective assessments on elements like consumer satisfaction and financial strength . " We developed CarrierCompare to be much more than just a company database , " QuoteWizard Content Manager Adam Johnson said in a press release . " When users access a company page on CarrierCompare , they also have the option to directly compare it alongside another insurance company . This allows consumers to easily evaluate the policy options , potential discounts , strengths , weaknesses , and more , all free of charge . " The bootstrapped startup has been family owned since its founding in 2006 and , for a time , was one of the fastest growing companies in Washington state .
